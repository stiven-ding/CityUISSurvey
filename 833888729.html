<h1 id="h:the-grand-duchy-of-r" class="page-anchor">The Grand Duchy of Reme awaits!</h1>
<p>Starting in 2002 Necromancer Games began populating its Lost Lands campaign setting one adventure at a time. The Grand Duchy of Reme is the region home to classic adventures released by Necromancer Games for D20/3.x and Frog God Games for Pathfinder, Swords &amp; Wizardry and Fifth Edition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 10 adventures have brought life to the Grand Duchy of Reme. <a href="https://lost-lands.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lost Lands Campaign Sourcebook</a> funded in January is expected to be over 700 pages and all of them are full of information. By necessity each region was described broadly, but there are still a wealth of history, politics and other details to be explored, experience and expanded in the Grand Duchy of Reme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Grand Duchy of Reme is a system neutral hardcover volume designed to be useful for campaigns independent of system preference. Specific details that affect the characters in the Lost Lands there are System Encounter Books. These companion volumes are softcover (or PDF), that contain reference stats for use with the Region book along with detailed encounter tables for the region.</p>
<p>Additionally, 3 classic adventures previously unavailable for Pathfinder, Swords &amp; Wizardry, and Fifth Edition are back. These are offered as either softcover add-ons in backerkit or as free stretch goals in PDF (see reward sidebar).</p>

<p>The city of Reme itself is ancient, with world-spanning trade — the eternal citadel of the Loreclans, where the ashes of legendary barbarian kings reside. This land lies near the slow collapse of the nearby Empire of Foere, and the rise of Bard’s Gate to the East. The Rhemish watch these events with cold eyes rather than concern, for they live in vast regions that devour invaders. Their land is eternal; their people can be forced back to the plains, but in the plains they can abide for as long as need be. They are — as a people — the ultimate hunters. The fall of Foere is like the fall of an antelope upon the plains; the rise of Bard’s Gate is little more than the stepping-up of jackals before the body. The Grand Duchy of Reme simply waits and watches — for Reme is the dwelling-place of the world’s wolves.</p>

<p>Reme is a unique fantasy civilization whose structure is determined by the one overriding fact of its geography — the country is a vast, grassland plain. The realm is dominated by the culture of the ancient Loreclans: the urbanized and settled ones, and the nomadic clans of the interior. The Loreclans owe a certain fealty to the Dukes of Reme, who are the final arbiters of the ancient law of the plains, but between the Loreclans and the Dukes there are also the mysterious Pashtars: arbiters, judges, and mediators who roam the plains where their service takes them.</p>

<p>The city of Reme, of course, is one of the wonders of the world of the Lost Lands, home of powerful spell-casters and perhaps the greatest mercantile and war fleets of the Crescent Sea. It is also, however, steeped in the culture of the vast plains of the interior. It is a place where assumptions are dangerous, for it is no standard fantasy environment — it is a culture that will be entirely new and foreign to your players, a place to truly explore as well as adventure.</p>

Ask any of our fans that have bought this pledge before, it’s truly a wonderful experience! <span class="bold">This reward also includes automatic entry into a game game run by Frog God at North Texas RPG Con or at Gamehole Con!</span>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>All Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say "library binding." &nbsp;That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more&nbsp;than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use. &nbsp;After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). <span class="bold">PLEASE NOTE! The POD option for this books is a softcover book and is NOT library bound. That being said, it is significantly less expensive to ship if you live outside the US.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<h1 id="h:backerkit" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">BackerKit</span></h1>
<p>Backerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward!&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:digital-reward-shipp" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Digital Reward Shipping</span></h1>
<p>We will email groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.</p>
<h1 id="h:physical-reward-ship" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Physical Reward Shipping</span></h1>
<p>When the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.</p>
<h1 id="h:shipping-damage-or-o" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Shipping Damage or other Related Issues</span></h1>
<p>No matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw, or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.</p>
<h1 id="h:refunds" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Refunds</span></h1>
<p>If for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit, and Paypal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:overseas-shipping" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Overseas Shipping</span></h1>
<p><span class="bold">This hardcover book likely will cost around $60 to $80 to ship to non-US customers.</span> We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart.&nbsp;Due to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70, or even $100 to reship.&nbsp;We discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service.&nbsp;We will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books — and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. We hate to do this — but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas.&nbsp;We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
