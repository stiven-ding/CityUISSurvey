<p><span class="text-italic">On a cool evening in the town of Los Castores, a lawyer summons a small group of strangers into his office. Obediah Felkner, a prominent resident and claim owner of a nearby quicksilver mine, has recently passed away from a mysterious illness. Surprisingly, a group of complete strangers have been named as his beneficiaries. The claim to Felkner’s mine could become theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-italic">However, Felkner’s last will contains a peculiar condition: in order to claim the deed to the mine, the party must collect a holy relic known as the Hand of San Roque and deliver it to Felkner’s grieving widow before dawn. The artifact is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the old Mission San Roque, abandoned by the Spanish almost 40 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-italic">And should they refuse? The lawyer points out they, too, have contracted the same disease that claimed the life of Mr. Felkner, and the retrieval of the relic is their only hope if they wish to survive the mysterious deadly affliction.</span></p>

<h1 id="h:summary" class="page-anchor">Summary</h1>
<p><span class="text-italic">The Last Will and Testament of Obediah Felkner</span> is a horror-themed western adventure designed for 4-to-6 1st-level characters. This product is compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. The adventure contains pre-generated western-themed DCC RPG characters, so no additional supplements are required. That said, it has been playtested with both David Baity's upcoming <a href="http://www.darktrailsrpg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dark Trails RPG</a> and Stormlord Publishing's <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147469/Black-Powder-Black-Magic-Vol1?affiliate_id=181121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Powder, Black Magic</a> DCC supplement with delightful results. There is an appendix “Running this adventure with Dark Trails” providing the judge ideas on how to fully leverage the <span class="text-italic">Dark Trails</span> ruleset with this adventure.</p>
<p>This full-length, standalone adventure will be between 24 to 28 pages in length. The adventure is completely written, edited, and thoroughly playtested. It currently contains art from some of your favorite DCC RPG artists including FRK Pyron, Stefan Poag, Danny Prescott, Sonya Prince, and Aaron Robinson. The adventure will be released as an 8.5 x 11 booklet with color cover and black and white interior pages.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! A limited-edition alternate foil-cover will be released and made available for sale only to Kickstarter backers. For an example of the foil cover, check out the one released for <span class="text-italic">Children of the Fallen Sun</span>.</p>
<p>And finally, you will have the option to receive a &nbsp;<span class="text-italic">Dark Trails Quick Start Guide </span>PDF discount code! See below for details.</p>
<h1 id="h:spoiler-details" class="page-anchor">Spoiler Details</h1>
<p>The adventure is loaded with goodies. Filthy spoilers ahead so if you’re planning on enjoying this adventure as a player you may want to skip to the next section.</p>
<p>Only judges here? OK, here’s what goodies you’ll get in the adventure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The bulk of the adventure takes place in a fictional California Mission. Despite being a western, like many of my adventures there’s a strong horror theme where the players will eventually discover there’s a mystery going on at the old Spanish Mission and not everything is quite what it seems…</li>
  <li>The adventure has approximately 12 keyed encounters, as well as starting and ending events.</li>
  <li>A full-page black and white mission map illustrated by Stefan Poag.</li>
  <li>The appendix includes descriptions of 3 new magic items (including the artifact The Hand of San Roque), at least 3 illustrated player handouts, and 10 pre-generated 1st-level PCs which can be used as-is or as examples on how to modify a standard DCC class into a western-themed PC.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="h:stretch-goals" class="page-anchor">Stretch Goals</h1>
<p>Given that the adventure is almost entirely complete, I will be keeping the stretch goals modest, as I’d like to get the adventure in your hands as soon as possible. Still, I wanted to offer a little something as a thank you to Kickstarter backers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>At $3000: Stickers for print backers! Each print copy of the adventure will include &nbsp;two 3"x3” stickers: one of the Thick Skull Adventures logo (see below), and another with a new design which will be inspired by one of the pieces of art within the adventure.</li>
  <li>At $4000: Four additional pages. The adventure is currently 24 pages, but you can help make it 28! The new pages would most likely be a combination of new pieces of art as well as some more background material write ups of the prominent NPCs encountered in Los Castores.</li>
  <li>At $5500: A full patron write up. Spoiler alert: within the adventure, there is an otherworldly entity meddling with humankind in nefarious ways. At this level, I will do a full write-up of this entity as a patron and include an accompanying piece of art.</li>

<h1 id="h:shipping-costs" class="page-anchor">Shipping Costs</h1>
<p>Each adventure will ship either in a cardboard envelope or bubble pack via Media Mail. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE LEVELS. This is to protect everyone involved in case there is an unforeseen rate increase in postal costs between funding and final shipping. At the time of launch, shipping and handling is planned to be an economical $5 per book shipped which is charged separate from the pledge levels. Rest assured that we will do everything within our power to ship your books to you the cheapest and most economical way possible.</p>
<p>Any changes beyond our control to the expected shipping costs resulting from postal rate increases will be fully announced in updates if such a situation arises.</p>
<p>All shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA ONLY, so please pledge accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bold">But what about international orders?</span> If you’re outside the US and want a copy, the standard cover will eventually be available through the Goodman Games and Game Kastle online store(s). If you are outside the US and want a foil cover, please send me a direct message and I will try to determine the most economical way to accommodate the request – most likely as a special order.</p>
<h1 id="h:pdf-fulfillment" class="page-anchor">PDF Fulfillment</h1>
<p>PDF copies will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG.com. A survey will be sent out requesting you submit a copy of your DriveThruRPG email address and that will be used to ship a code in order to download the adventure.</p>
