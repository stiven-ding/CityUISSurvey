The original sketchbook was smaller in size. This sketchbook was funded on Kickstarter and received positive reviews but also feedback for improvements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With the advice of fellow playing card designer, Lance Miller, RJ made some improvements to the original product. Now the sketchbook is bigger and on better quality drawing paper.</p>

<p>The Playing Card Designer sketchbook and pad is a simple but very useful tool for putting your dreams on paper. For any designer the worst part of designing playing cards is the tedious task of creating a template that allows you to create intricate symmetrical work. Now with the Playing Card Designer sketchbook and pad you can start designing immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:why-a-sketchbook" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Why a sketchbook?</span></h1>
<p>For this product, necessity is the mother of invention. Playing Card designer and producer, RJ Tomlinson wanted a sketchbook to have around at all times for committing ideas to paper. Since there isn't any sketchbooks around for this use we decided to create one. With the playing card community so active here on Kickstarter we decided to share our sketchbook with all.&nbsp;</p>

<h1 id="h:the-inside-pages" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">The Inside Pages</span></h1>
<p>Inside we have several differnt page layouts, all seperated with colored divider pages. These page layouts include a large full sheet page design, quarter pages with actual card sizes, tuck case layout pages and pip layout pages.</p>
<p>The inside pages are printed with 100% cyan ink. This allows artists to easily scan the artwork into Photoshop and extract the cyan grids thus leaving only the artwork.</p>

<p>We've already invested in the prototype phase of the project, that's why we can keep our funding goal at a low range. Keep in mind that this sketchbook is an item we developed for our own personal use. Our desire now is to share it with whomever thinks they that might find use out of it also. For us, the most important thing is to give artists a tool to help grow the playing card community.</p>
<p>If the project is successful, we plan to have all sketchbooks shipped out by the end of August 2019.</p>
<p>We would like to thank you for looking at this project. We would greatly appreciate your support.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">With any project you can run into unexpected delays.
