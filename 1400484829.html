<p><span class="bold">*** </span>If you're a backer from a country not currently listed in the Reward Levels, post a Comment and I'll add your country <span class="bold">***</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">What Is Puzzometry?</span></p>
<p>Puzzometry is a cool and unique kind of puzzle made from laser-cut 0.22" thick acrylic.&nbsp; There is no picture on the puzzle as you would find on a jigsaw puzzle.&nbsp; The concept is a simple one: can you fit all of pieces into the frame?&nbsp; Trust me, it's much more difficult than it seems! &nbsp;&nbsp;If you're thinking Puzzometry provides a challlenge similar to a jigsaw puzzle, think again! &nbsp;These puzzles are more of a brainteaser along the lines of the various mechanical games&nbsp;and logic games.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are literally thousands of possibilities! Can you find the correct one to solve Puzzometry?</p>
<p>With your help, hopefully this project will allow me to cover the initial setup expenses &nbsp;involved with the design and testing of these new puzzles!</p>
<p><span class="bold">The Newest Members of the Puzzometry Family</span></p>
<p>The three new puzzles are called: &nbsp;"Puzzometry Steps", "Puzzometry Six" and "Puzzometry Jr 2".</p>
<p>These new puzzles are the same physical size and share the same aesthetic look as the previous Puzzometry Puzzles, but they are based on a new set of geometric patterns. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="bold">"Puzzometry Steps"</span>: &nbsp;All of the pieces of this puzzle are based on a tessellation of &nbsp;a "plus sign" shape as you can see in the image below. &nbsp;Puzzometry Steps has 13 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="bold">"Puzzometry Six"</span>: &nbsp;All of the pieces of Puzzometry Six are based on a tessellation of slightly squished hexagons as shown in the below image. &nbsp;Puzzometry Six has 14 pieces.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"Puzzometry Jr 2"</span>: &nbsp;This puzzle has 7 pieces just like the original Puzzometry Jr, but all of its pieces are from a subset of the 13 pieces of Puzzometry Steps. &nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be surprised if these 7 pieces provide a bigger challenge than you might guess!</p>
<p><span class="bold">The Other Members Of The Puzzometry Family</span></p>
<p>There are 4 existing members of the Puzzometry family. &nbsp;One of the backer levels on this project will allow you to get the entire family of 7 puzzles!</p>

</div>


<p>- <span class="bold">Puzzometry (Original)</span>: This is the original 14 piece brainteaser based on a tessellation of octagons and tiny squares! &nbsp;A beautiful and challenging introduction to the Puzzometry Product Line</p>
<p>- <span class="bold">Puzzometry Squares</span>: This puzzle also has 14 pieces and all of the shapes are based on a tessellation of square and rectangular patterns!</p>
<p>-<span class="bold"> Puzzometry Jr</span>: This puzzle is made of a selection of 7 of the 14 pieces from the Original Puzzometry. &nbsp;Only 7 pieces, but don't underestimate the challenge of this one!</p>
<p>- <span class="bold">Puzzometry Hex:</span> This is the fourth member of the family. &nbsp;It's based on a tessellation of hexagon shapes and it was launched as a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/puzzometry2/puzzometry-hex-and-the-blarglefish-frc-team-1255-b?ref=user_menu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter Project in 2014</a>. &nbsp;This puzzle has 12 pieces and has multiple solutions to make the difficulty a bit more....well, a bit less challenging! &nbsp;However, trust me...it's still &nbsp;a challenge!</p>
<p><span class="bold">More Information</span></p>
<p>All of the Puzzometry puzzles take just a few seconds to understand, but they can take hours to solve.&nbsp; The difficulty of the puzzle can't be overstated! &nbsp;They are VERY CHALLENGING!&nbsp;<span class="bold">In spirit of challenging all of you puzzle lovers, the solution to Puzzometry will NOT be mailed out with the rewards. &nbsp;</span>Of course, if you're really stuck and in a moment of weakness you need some help, a clue is only an email away!</p>
<p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Please read the backer levels carefully</span></span><span class="bold"> so that you know for sure which puzzle(s) you are selecting.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Follow us on twitter </span><a href="http://www.twitter.com/Puzzometry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Puzzometry</a><span class="bold"> and on </span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/Puzzometry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a></p>
<p><span class="bold">2-Player Strategy Game</span></p>
<p>With the exception of the two Jr puzzles, all of the Puzzometry puzzles also can be used for a two-player strategy game. &nbsp;When playing the two-person strategy game (<span class="text-italic">Game Mode</span>), Puzzometry is a fast-paced, fun strategy game that requires thinking ahead and playing defense! Players alternate putting pieces into the frame with the goal being to leave not enough remaining space in the frame for your opponent to play his or her next piece!</p>
<p>----------------------------</p>
<p><span class="bold">The backer levels have delivery dates of January, 2020, but my goal is to delivery all rewards to backers in time for Christmas!</span></p>
<p>I have organized and delivered FOUR successfully funded Kickstarter projects since 2012 and have provided organizational input and advice to another successfully funded Kickstarter project.</p>
<p>My goal is to deliver ALL rewards in time for Christmas. But please note that if we get totally swamped by tons and tons of backers (several hundred), then there is a chance that a few of them will get pushed out beyond Christmas.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting Puzzometry! Please spread the word about this project to your friends!</p>

I have a manufacturer ready and willing to make the puzzles as soon as the project gets funding (We will likely start production even before the project ends if it looks as though it will get fully funded).  I've successfully completed several previous Kickstarter projects and feel confident that this one will also get delivered on time.   If this project gets 'super funded' and we get overwhelmed with backers, there's always a chance that some deliveries may get pushed back a few weeks.    But the goal will be to get all backer rewards in the mail in time for Christmas!</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/puzzometry/puzzometry-still-the-hardest-puzzle-you-will-never-solve/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
