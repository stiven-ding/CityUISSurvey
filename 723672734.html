The game is based on a sci-fi custom developed universe by our writing team. We are in the process of releasing via Steam, Itch.io and the Google Play Store. This game contains descriptions of sexual themes(not full on nudity or pornography of a graphic nature), violence, drug and alcohol use. This will be an early access title and people will be able to help us develop the game as we progress; we will provide updates to the community and give everyone who backs beyond $10 a free key to the game.</p>
<p>If you want more info about us you can join our <a href="https://discord.gg/sdY5V8Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> which has further details on our project.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the game:</p>
<p>In the distant future where Humanity has expanded far beyond Earth into a war-torn, conflict filled galaxy a young woman struggles through her life and adventures gaining friends, learning about herself and working to save her galaxy. The New Universes Project's Eine Neue Reise Beginnt First Chapter follows Sumire Rembrant an estranged princess whom moves to an academy in space in an effort to help her sister and learn more about herself. As she moves through her adventures Sumire encounters her past, finds love and builds a new future for herself. This story is the adaptation of the first set of The New Universes Project Eine Neue Reise Beginnt stories.</p>
<p>Here are our funding goals:</p>
<p>At 500 dollars we will have the base funds required to complete our product and ship out keys.</p>
<p>At 1000 dollars we hope to send out a few disc based copies of the game to the highest level backers and have this collectors edition for sale through our website.</p>
<p>At 5000 dollars our developer hopes to work to develop DLCs that will add mini-games and puzzle content to the game to allow for more interactivity within the game.</p>
<p>IF we hit 10000 dollars we plan to develop our own engine for the game and develop a path towards sequel games.</p>
<p>At 30000 dollars we would have enough money to employ a staff member full time to coordinate the game, ship out CD based copies of the game and complete everything else mentioned above. This is our Ideal goal but at 500 dollars we would be able to just release our game; which is the bare minimum we need to develop the game and release it for sale.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of currently where our game stands:</p>
