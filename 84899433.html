<p><span class="bold">What’s all the BS about?</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Bunny Stasis a fun filled game where 2-6 people try to be the last bunny standing! Surviving the stresses and planning is part of the strategy but being the last bunny standing is the goal of the game. Each turn players draw cards and discard cards in order to increase their chances of not going into stasis. Be careful though, because if you make one of the other bunnies upset then there could be a group of bunnies after you!</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">Basic Rules :</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Game Set Up</span></p>
<p>· Remove deck from box</p>
<p>· Before shuffling deck remove the 6 Midnight ER Cards, 8 Bunny Characters (32 cards total) , and 2 Ultimate Bunny Crisis Cards.</p>
<p>· Have each player select 1 of the 8 bunnies. Each bunny has 4 phases which are numbered and color coated: 1-Blue (normal), 2-Yellow (agitated), 3-Red (irritated) and 4-Purple (Stressed). Make sure you have all 4 phases.</p>
<p>· Once each player has selected a bunny, shuffle the main deck (excluding Midnight ER and Ultimate Bunny Crisis cards) and pass out 2 cards from the deck to each player. Each player is then passed out 1 Midnight ER card and the rest of the Midnight ER cards and Ultimate Bunny Crisis cards are now shuffled into the deck. Adding the extra Midnight ER card is optional.</p>
<p>· The deck is then placed at the center of the table.</p>
<p>· Each player then sets up their bunny starting with number 1.</p>
<p>Easiest set up looks like this:</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</p>
<p><span class="bold">How to Play</span></p>
<p>· The turn player draws a card.</p>
<p>· The turn player must play one of his cards on his turn. A card must be played and discarded into the discard pile.</p>
<p>· There are 9 cards that each cause an action:</p>

<p>o <span class="bold">Feed</span> – moves any character of choice down a stress level (<span class="bold">you can not go below 1)</span></p>
<p>o <span class="bold">Stress</span> – moves any character of choice up a stress level (<span class="bold">Yes you can stress and feed any bunny!</span>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>o <span class="bold">Double Feed</span> – moves any character down 2 stress levels&nbsp;</p>
<p>o <span class="bold">Double Stress</span> – moves any character up 2 stress levels</p>
<p>o <span class="bold">Reverse</span> – reverses the order at play&nbsp;</p>
<p>o <span class="bold">Hop</span> – skip any persons’ turn</p>
<p>o <span class="bold">Ultimate</span> <span class="bold">Bunny Crisis</span> – if this card is drawn it <span class="bold">must be played,</span> you cannot choose to play another card, and this ends your turn. If each bunny is at the same stress level nothing happens. If there is at least one bunny is at a different level then each bunny (of current level) is flipped upside down and shuffled together. The player that drew the card passes then randomly passes out the cards and players then exchange cards and are the bunny at what level it was at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>o <span class="bold">Trading Lifestyles</span> – Exchange bunnies’ levels between any 2 people (<span class="bold">you can choose 2 other people besides yourself</span>).</p>
<p>o <span class="bold">Midnight Emergency Room – </span>This card puts your bunny all the way back to level 1<span class="bold">. </span>You can play this card anytime during the game when you hit level 4-purple. This card puts you back on level 1 but be careful because once these cards are played, they are removed from the game and don’t get shuffled in again. If you use this card at any time you don’t get to draw another card to replace it. You can also play this card on your turn but it is removed from game. You do not have to be at level 4 to use this card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>o <span class="bold">(Note: Moving a character characters stress level Is just moving to the next sequential card up or down)</span></p>
<p>· When cards run out from the draw pile, remove 2 feed card then shuffle the discard pile to keep playing. Do not add the removed Midnight Emergency Room cards.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Objective</span></p>
<p>· Be the last bunny standing</p>
<p>· Keep an eye out for how many Emergency Room cards have been used and who has used them to see who is more vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>· Stress out all the other bunnies and survive before stasis occurs</p>
<p>· Be diplomatic convince others to try not to stress you and instead go after someone else.</p>
<p>· At any point in the game <span class="bold">if you reach level 4</span> and do not have a midnight emergency run card to use, you are out.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bold">What do you get?</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">The game is a standalone game so there are no tiers to increase the product, so you get a copy or copies of the game depending on your donation.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Below is the picture of the deck that you will receive. Each deck is a 100 card deck and are poker sized cards with a card Stock of &nbsp;300gsm premium with a smooth finish.</span><br>

<p><span class="bold">Hi Irving, here the creator of Bunny Stasis. Let me tell you a story about how the game came to be. The picture is of my wife and her bunny. Yes, both exist in real life. While we were dating, she would express to me the things that stressed her out. I would listen all the time, but my wife’s stresses were well how you would say, not like everyone else’s. Sometimes the simplest things would stress her out and then we were in full panic mode. It was like nothing I had ever seen before and it came in stages from normal, to irritated, to agitated, to pure panic. This brought me to the idea of how we all stress in life, how we go from highs to lows at different times. I thought wow we as people really live stressful lives. But how we each handle it is more interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">I truly thought that people really had it bad with all the things we stress about. Well, meet Princess, the bunny with a million stresses. She would stress for the strangest things at times from an unwanted guest appearing, to not having enough hay, to not having enough people paying attention to her. She truly was becoming a royal pain, until finally my wife told me about this crazy defense mechanism that bunnies have called G.I Stasis. Whenever Princess got stressed out she would go from irritated, agitated, and then to stasis. Seriously? The stresses of this bunny’s life caused her to go into stasis and in order to take her stress down a notch we would have to hand feed her over and over again to correct it. The first time we were able to hand feed her enough to fix it but the second time was a disaster. This time we had to make a midnight emergency room run to save her. The trip was weird as I was watching Princess and my wife mimicking each other, I was worried half the time that Princess would go further into stasis and that my wife would then follow suit! After multiple trips to the ER, an idea for a game popped into my head based on all the humorous Princess incidents.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="bold">The game</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">So, it all started with an idea how about a game where it is all about stress! All of us can relate... It was a simple idea that all of sudden grew and was sitting in front of me in a fake stack of cards that needed to be tested. I remember thinking to myself, “Is this how games get started”? I loved games and played many with the family but this was something new for me. First testing began with my family. Who else better to test with; we were having fun! It was enjoyable and we played it over and over. This was easy to do then the real issue; how others would feel playing it. I remember showing up at a local game shop one night and just asking friends if they would test this game I made. I pulled out this deck with just words and began showing them. They had more fun than I had anticipated. It was on that day that one of them said something that finally struck a chord in me “This seriously needs to be a real thing”. Simple words that would make me want to see more people laugh and yell at my game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">I only have one thing left and this is where you all come in. The dream is to make this game come more alive than it is and I would love to see my vision go out into the world! Watching other people laugh and enjoy the game is what it's all about! I need everyone’s help to share the game so more people know about it. I truly appreciate every one of you and thank you for keeping Princess out of stress!</span></p>
