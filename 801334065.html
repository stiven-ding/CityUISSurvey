<p>My Known Universe is the party game that proves you're interesting.</p>
<p>This game is all about connecting yourself to the people and the world around us. To play, a player draws a Nexus card. Many of the Nexus cards list a famous person, a well-known place, or an event. After reading the card aloud, each player tries to connect to who or what is listed on the card through people they know, places they've been, or things they've done. See our video for a quick example!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Nexus cards have a question instead. When a Nexus card is drawn that lists a question, the play is the same. Each player simply responds to the question with a truthful response. After each player shares his connection story or answers the question on the Nexus card, everyone votes on the best response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes a response "the best"? That's up to each player, although we do have some guidelines in the rules to assist players when making their choices. When two stories are tied for best, another player draws one of the hilarious (and possibly controversial) Tiebreaker cards. The player who receives the most votes (or wins the Tiebreaker) keeps the Nexus card, and the first player to collect five Nexus cards is dubbed the Most Interesting Person in the Room.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="bold">The Creator(s)</span></p>
<p>I am a college student who created this game with the help of my awesome family for a high school project. After seeing how much people enjoy playing the game, I decided to make this game a reality. It is truly a group effort by a whole family with the youngest at the helm.</p>
