It’s time to ditch these. <b>It’s time to use clean, efficient wind energy to power your devices!</b>

                    <img class="photo" src="./medium verbal-2/img7.jpg" >The Shine Turbine is the ultra-compact, highly efficient, portable wind charger that lets you use the wind to rapidly create your own power to charge all your handheld devices - from your phone to your camera - anytime, anywhere the wind blows.
                    <img class="photo" src="./medium verbal-2/img8.jpg" >From exploring coasts to navigating plains to scaling mountains, all you need to do is set up Shine and in under 2 minutes, you’ll have a wind generator to power your adventures. You can charge it whenever you want and its battery can fully power things like your iPad or phone. 12.000mAh battery can charge up to 4 devices and 3 phones worth of power can be collected in as little as an hour.
                    <img class="photo" src="./medium verbal-2/img17.jpg" >Access to renewable power off-grid is essential as electronics often require more charging power than portable batteries can provide. Solar panels don't always work when you need them to. Generators are loud and expensive and battery packs always die. With Shine you have the freedom to charge and explore on your own terms, day and night, rain, cloud, or shine.

                    As nature lovers and outdoor adventurers, we spent the last three years developing a product, delivers all the benefits of a large wind turbine, scaled down to fit in your backpack.
                    <br> <br>
                    It's super lightweight with the highest power-to-weight ratio compared to solar panels water turbines and thermoelectric stoves. This means you're getting the most power for the least amount of weight you have to carry. Also, it's incredibly quiet with maximum of 50 dB!
                    
                    <img class="photo" src="./medium verbal-2/img26.jpg" ><b>Shine has distinctive advantages<br></b>
                    (1) The turbine weighs 3 lbs and collapses into the size of a water bottle so you can have access to wind power wherever you go.
                    <br>(2) Set up takes 2 minutes or less with everything you need stored inside the turbine.
                    <br>(3) Access energy whenever you need it or precharge Shine via a wall outlet.
                    <br>(4) Power your devices even when it's raining and withstand sand, dirt, and dust build-up.
                    <br>(5) Doesn’t require a phone, Bluetooth, or any other device to generate power.
                    <br>(6) Produce clean wind energy and reduce your ecological impact.
                    <br>(7) Durability: made of aircraft-grade aluminum, and injection-molded polycarbonate-reinforced plastic to withstand the wear and tear of the outdoors; built-in heat dissipation for operation at high wind speeds.

                    Plug a USB cable into Shine to power devices while the turbine is in operation or stowed. Plug your phone into Shine while at basecamp, or pack Shine up and continue to power devices while the turbine is stowed in your pack. This 40-watt ultra-compact wind charger can power any handheld USB device, including phones, tablets, lights, drones, cameras, GPS, speakers, e-readers, headphones, power banks, and more.  
                    <br> <br>
                    Shine creates energy faster than any other handheld renewable product. It is able to collect three phones' worth of power in an hour at maximum rated wind speeds.    
                    
                    <img class="photo" src="./medium verbal-2/img29.jpg" >Shine is for anyone who wants to charge handheld devices while disconnected from the energy grid. The turbine is perfect for keeping electronics charged while backpacking, camping, RVing, fishing, hunting, remote working, and more. You will have a non-stop source of power to keep your phone running and a light to see in the dark. Head out on an adventure!
                    <img class="photo" src="./medium verbal-2/img63.jpg" >The Shine Turbine team has been developing the product since 2018 and has overcome countless technical hurdles. These ranged from optimizing the pivot point to face Shine into the wind, to fitting everything needed to set up the turbine inside its internal compartment, to its patent-pending turbine design that provides portability without sacrificing efficiency!   
                    <br> <br>
                    Aurea Technologies, the company behind Shine, is based in the coastal province of Nova Scotia, Canada, where there’s never a shortage of wind!
                    <br> <br>
                    We're a team of outdoor lovers with a passion for clean energy and the environment. With years of expertise in wind turbine engineering, supply chain management, production, and customer service, we're beyond ready to bring you the future of portable wind charging!
                    <br> <br>
                    We’re nearly at the finish line! Shine is currently undergoing product certification and once this is complete, we can start deliveries. We’ve started production beginning with the product’s mechanical sub-assemblies. This will give us the ability to promptly fulfill orders as soon as Shine passes certification.
