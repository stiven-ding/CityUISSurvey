                    It’s a new era in fashion innovation -- the first highly functional, durable vegan leather. A
                    vintage look and feel, from materials created to last well into the future. Function meets fashion
                    in the timeless MOONRAKERS Vegan Leather Coat.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s Japanese innovation & craftsmanship, the precision-designed fabric that is made to last.
                    Reimagine leather with NANODESIGN™ technology, combining both comfort of natural materials and the
                    functionality of synthetics.

                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-1/img5.jpg">MOONRAKER's 0.3mm ultra-thin fabric made from 0.19
                    decitex ultrafine fibers. The innovative design of fabric cross section and special yarn structure
                    provides the strength and feel of leather at ultra-lightweight.

                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-1/img9.jpg">The new era vegan leather with innovative design
                    and texture brings whole new feel and one-of-a-kind style. Artisanal “garment dyeing” by Japanese
                    craftsmen gives your MOONRAKERS a unique color and vintage, naturally worn look that styles your
                    way. This hand-dyed garment’s tasteful vintage-like color elevates any outfit from sweaters to
                    T-shirts.

                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-1/img12.gif">The high-density weave of the fabric is wind
                    resistant and weather-proof with high water repellency. It allows for an air permeability of 0.33cc
                    or lees, perfect for transitioning through the seasons. You can wear this very unconventional coat
                    in fall, winter and spring even in the hardcore outdoor weather and damp conditions.
                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-1/img13.jpg">As we innovate with fabrics, we weave in
                    traditional craftsmanship by delicately hand-dying each coat, so no two colors are exactly alike.
                    But every coat we craft is ultra-light, weather-proof, and versatile throughout the year.
                    <br><br>
                    Our ultra-thin NANODESIGN™ fabrics provide all the comfort and qualities of traditional leather
                    while offering high functionality for weatherproof. We continually research and innovate the
                    creation of fabrics that provide the comfort and familiarity of natural materials and allow us to go
                    beyond conventional functions and textures.

                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-1/img22.jpg">Like leather, but better. Toray's NANODESIGN™
                    Technology gives you all the feel without all the weight. Ultra-thin, durable, and completely
                    ethical, the MOONRAKERS vegan leather coat has endurable style.

                    carry, around 1.1lbs / 500g. Simply fold it up in a flash with no need to worry about wrinkles. Turn
                    your MOONRAKERS into a novel size -- only 1.2 inches (3cm) thick. Zip the bag shut and easily pack
                    it alongside whatever you’re traveling with. Your MOONRAKERS Vegan Leather Coat arrives complete
                    with a 18cm*25cm storage bag.

                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-1/img31.jpg">We’ve successfully done this in Japan through
                    Makuake earlier in January 2021 with 500+ backers supporting us. All the fulfillment is completed in
                    June 2021 with lots of happy backers.
                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-1/img32.jpg">We are a sustainable apparel brand that respects
                    nature in two ways. By crafting a coat that is worthy of being worn almost year-round in harsh
                    weather, and by using innovative materials that last into the future to eliminate waste.
                    <br><br>
                    We are proudly backed by Toray Group from Japan, one of the world’s largest textile companies.
                    Beginning with MOONRAKERS, we hope to transform the apparel industry. Welcome to the first act of
                    our sustainable fashion movement.
