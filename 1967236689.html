<p>In the town of Sleepy Hollow, Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of wealthy &nbsp;landowner Baltus Van Tassel, has two suitors vying for her hand in &nbsp;marriage: Brohm Van Brunt, a local burly townsman looking to improve his &nbsp;livelihood, and Ichabod Crane, a refined outsider whose intellect is &nbsp;rivaled only by his penchant for belief in the supernatural. Curiously, &nbsp;the inception of this love triangle also marks the genesis of much &nbsp;paranormal activity in Sleepy Hollow. Tales of a mysterious "Headless &nbsp;Horseman" have rattled the community, and the whispers imply that he &nbsp;seeks to head off any engagement to Katrina,,, literally. The object of &nbsp;the game is to successfully marry Katrina to one of her suitors, or to &nbsp;thwart the impending marriage by reuniting the Horseman to his Head.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Game Play:</span></p>
<p>Shuffle cards and deal 2-4 players one card each. After each turn &nbsp;player keeps only 1 card in-hand. During a turn, player draws a card and &nbsp;does one of the following:</p>
<p>Makes no play and discards one of their two cards face-down in the discard pile.</p>
<p>Plays a Character Card by placing it in front of them. (Players are &nbsp;only allowed 2 Character Cards in front of them unless they have an &nbsp;Innkeeper played, see Special Situations.*)</p>
<p>Plays a Townsfolk Card by reading it aloud and following the instructions.</p>
<p>A player wins the round when they have Katrina and either Brom or &nbsp;Ichabod played in front of them, and the minister card is played &nbsp;(barring the subsequent play of the Bishop). Alternately, any player who &nbsp;holds both the Head and the Horseman in their hand may play them at any &nbsp;time for an instant win (barring the subsequent play of the &nbsp;Blacksmith). First Player to win 2 rounds wins Sleepy Hollow!</p>
<p>For ages 8 and up.</p>
<p>Play time: 10-30 minutes.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cards in Deck:</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">Reviews from Seattle Indies Expo jurors:</span></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I've played a number of games in the style, and this one is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;competent and fun. It's something I'd like to bring along on board game &nbsp;night to my local shop and play a few rounds with. I'm looking forward &nbsp;to seeing the final polished version of this game."</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; "The basic mechanics of the game are fun, and I'm intrigued &nbsp;by the&nbsp; concept of a Sleepy Hollow Card Game. Once we got the hang of &nbsp;it and got going, we had fun playing the game. I had the opinion in the &nbsp;beginning that it was going to be too easy to win, but there were plenty &nbsp;of ways to block people, which ended up being rather satisfying."</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; "The quickness and interesting premise of the card game is &nbsp;the main strength of this game. Figuring out why certain cards did what &nbsp;they did led to laughs, like "Why does the farmer get to see your hand? &nbsp;Oh cause they're always out in the field, able to peek on their &nbsp;neighbors."</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; "Interesting card dynamics, the way they worked didn't seem &nbsp;arbitrary, they were well integrated into the theme. Enjoyed &nbsp;interacting with other's hands, peeking, swapping hands, negating cards &nbsp;in play, etc."<br>
</p>
<p><span class="bold">Reviews from boardgamegeek.com for The Check Deck:</span></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; "A &nbsp;solid design. &nbsp;I thought this was going to be an uninspired knock-off &nbsp;of Knightmare chess, but it is actually an interesting and strategic &nbsp;knock-off. &nbsp;Judging when to use your 7 cards is interesting and tough, &nbsp;and having only 7 prevents the card powers from overwhelming the ability &nbsp;to plan ahead and set up classic checkers-style traps. &nbsp;Well done.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">The game is finished and tested.
