<h1 id="h:the-origins-of-the-l" class="page-anchor">The Origins of the Lost Lands</h1>
<p>For almost 20 years, glimpses into the world of the Lost Lands have been revealed in the publications of Frog God Games and Necromancer Games. The Lost Lands contain locations now legendary in the annals of roleplaying, from the depths of the massive dungeons of Rappan Athuk, to the city of Bard’s Gate, the Desolation of Tsar, the Blight, the demon-tainted Sundered Lands, the chaotic tumult of the Borderland Provinces, and the fabled Northlands. These publications offered hints of the sweeping scope, deep history, and epic grandeur of the Lost Lands. &nbsp;But only hints.</p>
<p>For well over a decade, a Lost Lands campaign world has been our customers' most requested project...</p>
<p>...and the time of the Lost Lands has now arrived!</p>

<p>We decided to do something a little different this time for stretch goals. We feel that everyone at a tier above the $1 level ought to benefit from hitting those goals, and it so happens that we've got lots of ready-made digital adventures that take place in the Lost Lands. So when each goal is hit, expect a new adventure to be added as a PDF file (your choice of Pathfinder, Swords and Wizardry or 5th Edition) to all pledges of $15 or more. That's right! <span class="bold">You get adventures to get started in the game world for FREE!</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">UNLOCKED!! $55,000 -- The Missing Pin by Alex Kammer (for 4 to 6 characters from 2nd to 4th level)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A valuable ruby pin has been stolen under strange circumstances, and its owner is willing to pay capable adventurers to track it down and return it. It will not (of course) be that simple. Nothing in the Lost Lands is as it seems. What looks like a heist perpetrated by a rival family in fact turns out to be an inside job. Reginald Reed, the very person who initially contacts the party, stole the valuable pin himself because he has fallen under the sway of a fey being who lives in a backwater marsh a few miles upriver. And then, things got worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bold">UNLOCKED!! $60,000 -- Nightstone Keep by Ed Greenwood (for 4 to 6 characters from 4th and 6th level)</span></p>
<p>This location-based adventure is centered on a ruined, long-disused stone keep in a wild forest. The characters will be able to explore the ruins of the keep, which have become a plant colony, and attempt to wrest a powerful treasure from the clutches of the araunglyd, a gigantic sentient fungus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bold">UNLOCKED!! $65,000 -- The Covered Bridge by Kevin Wright (for 4 to 6 characters of 4th to 6th level) &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Are the characters up to the challenge of solving the centuries-old murder of a historic hero? Within the adventure, the characters are caught up in the haunted memories of the ghostly knight and help him to accomplish his heroic deeds. While doing so, the party becomes familiar with his world and the murder suspects, picking up clues to their motivations and actions along the way. At the end of the adventure, an enraged spirit confronts the characters and demands that they name his killer. If they can do it, they are richly rewarded; both in treasure and the knowledge that they let a good man finally find rest. If they fail, they must face the chilling wrath of the deathless phantom<span class="bold">. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">UNLOCKED!! $70,000 -- A Midnight Council of Quail by Lance Hawvermale (for 4 to 6 characters from 3rd and 5th level) &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Archdruid Cadrryn is so old and mystical that his very presence often affects the natural world around him. Over the years, his close association with the region’s quail population has bestowed upon the birds a sentience uncommon to normal avians. With slightly advanced intelligence, the quail now act as local sentinels, reporting back to Cadrryn on all matters that transpire in his domain. But the druid has been away for more than a fortnight on business of the Druidic Order of Oescreheit, leaving the quail to decide on important events without his wise hand to guide them. When the birds learn that a sinister force has infiltrated the nearby village of Eorls Gedreas, where many of them roost upon the thatched rooftops, the quail convene to determine a way to fight back.</p>
<p><span class="bold">UNLOCKED!! $75,000 -- Lost Lands Commercial License and a Community Resource Hub for Backers/Supporters</span></p>

<p>What is more, Frog God Games is currently developing a community hub that will contain resources like reference materials, a published adventure directory and access to almost 2,000 illustrations that have appeared in Frog God Games and Necromancer Games products, all for use by creators. The Hub will be free to backers for <span class="bold">at least 3 months</span> and will have a very minimal fee thereafter (only to pay for maintenance and compensate the coordinator behind everything).</p>
<p>Other details will be forthcoming in updates and other channels as they are developed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bold">UNLOCKED!! $80,000 -- MCMLXXV (1975) by Bill Webb</span></p>
<p>This module is intended to show how old school roleplaying provides enhanced descriptions and provides not only storyline and encounters, but creates a feeling of “being there”. 1975 is meant to take you back to that time the “old-timers” talk about with a look of wistfulness in their eyes. Join us as we all travel back to 1975. <span class="text-italic">The other members of Frog God Games would like to go on record that we did attempt to change the title, but Bill Webb is the one who approves printer proofs.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">UNLOCKED!! $85,000 -- Grimmsgate by Matt Finch (for 4-6 characters of 1st Level)</span></p>
<p>Deep in the wooded wilderness, the village of Grimmsgate is an outpost town on a seldom-traveled trail, right at the edge of nowhere. The village’s half-ruined temple of Law, dilapidated inn, drunken blacksmith, exiled trader and a few fur-trappers are enough to keep the bloody-minded denizens of the dark forest at bay, but nobody really expects the village to still be there in another ten years. The woods have become too dangerous for the trappers who once caught animals for fur, and merchants no longer travel the poorly-maintained road. Grimmsgate is an introductory adventure for the Swords &amp; Wizardry tabletop roleplaying game<span class="bold">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">UNLOCKED!!&nbsp;$90,000 -- Rogues of Remballo, by Matt Finch (for 4-6 characters of 1st Level)</span></p>
<p>A city adventure set in the Borderland Provinces, the City of Remballo immediately gets first-level characters embroiled in strange plots, sinister intrigue, and fierce battles. Is the thieves’ guild of Manas encroaching on the territory of the Remballo guild? What is hidden in the sanctuary-courtyard known as the Four Corners? How is the powerful banking house of Borgandy involved with all of it? What starts as a straightforward mission actually involves a host of complications — some of which can be deadly if the characters don’t play their cards right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bold">UNLOCKED!! $95,000 -- The Riot Act by James Spahn (for 4 characters averaging 2nd level)</span></p>
<p>This adventure highlights several locations in Bard's Gate, especially those in the Bridge district. A mixture of encounters includes roleplaying, investigation, dungeon crawling, stealth, and combat. The adventure does not require any specific classes or races, though bards and rogues may be useful given the nature of their special abilities. It is assumed that the PCs are sympathetic to the Lyreguard or other agencies that serve the interests of Bard’s Gate — or at the very least that their loyalty can be purchased for a few gold coins.</p>

<h1 id="h:book-quality" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Book Quality</span></h1>
<p>All Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say "library binding." &nbsp;That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use. &nbsp;After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). &nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bold">PLEASE NOTE! There is no POD option for this book like we have offered to overseas customers on smaller books--this thing is just too big to glue bind. It would fall apart and you would be unhappy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1 id="h:backerkit" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">BackerKit</span></h1>
<p>Backerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward!&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:digital-reward-shipp" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Digital Reward Shipping</span></h1>
<p>We will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.</p>
<h1 id="h:physical-reward-ship" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Physical Reward Shipping</span></h1>
<p>When the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.</p>
<h1 id="h:shipping-damage-or-o" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Shipping Damage or other Related Issues</span></h1>
<p>No matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.</p>
<h1 id="h:refunds" class="page-anchor">Refunds</h1>
<p>If for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit and Paypal.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:overseas-shipping" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Overseas Shipping</span></h1>
<p><span class="bold">This book likely will cost around $80 to $100 to ship to non-US customers.</span> We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out.</p>
<p>We actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70 or even $100 to reship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books--and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. The shipping of the map only (6 panel map, no additional materials) will NOT incur the insurance charge, however postage will be charged at cost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hate to do this--but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">Frog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (23!) Kickstarter programs in the past. As with any crowdfunding program, the time-lapse between payment and delivery of a final product is subject to various risks, including the failure of a supplier, damage in shipment, disruptions within a company, invasions by carnivorous space rabbits and changes in the prices of materials and shipping. Experience gained over a number of projects makes us confident that we have contingency plans for the ordinary, foreseeable issues that might arise.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/froggodgames/the-world-of-the-lost-lands/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
