<p><span class="bold">Shoujiki Integrity Game</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pixel ID:&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are the right questions for interesting, fun, and meaningful conversations.</p>
<p>There are 7 friendly chibi animals. They are martial arts students with a light inside. The light grows stronger when they learn something. My Little Pony started out with a girls vision of a cartoon called My Pretty Pony. I want Hasbro to buy my cartoon and share it for kids who would benefit from a class of animals with a wise Sensei learning little life lessons. The bunny is Bonnie Bunny and when she thumps, gold sparkles come out making everyone calm. Rascal Raccoon has a mask that helps him see through to peoples feelings. I am currently creating a cartoon that I can pitch to Hasbro in detail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This game has friendly chibi animals, but this edition is not for children. Created to help people with peaceful conversation, and to articulate important things. This will spread to their own families, then out into a world that needs to communicate peacefully. It started with a vision to calm some of the political and religious conflict on social media, but it is also a really fun adult party game for friends, family and coworkers. Using question cards, the questions become increasingly controversial as one moves up the ranks from white belt to black &nbsp;belt.</p>
<p><span class="text-italic">SHOUJIKI –INTEGRITY - (Children's version and cartoon are coming soon)</span></p>
<p><span class="text-italic">The Game of Conversational Strength and Agility - Awaken your Inner Martial Artist</span></p>
<p>Introducing the Shoujiki Integrity Game. Details on how to play are on cards and in the book Shoujiki Integrity Game available on Amazon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a fun and enlightening conversational question game for adults. Using a martial arts theme, family, friends, and coworkers enjoy easy white belt questions such as “what was your first job?” and move forward to more complex questions about other people, honesty and religion. Players choose a Sensei who helps moderate the group as they move through the ranks to increasingly controversial questions. Friendly Chibi animals are a reminder to keep the mood light with good humor as questions become more difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions are designed to help players think for themselves, but also to bring the group together. Everyone joins in to help players match the number of words to the number on the dice rolled. This evens the conversation by limiting how many words others can use to answer, but encouraging quieter players to speak up. Shoujiki is the Japanese word for honesty or integrity. Integrity in the Shoujiki Integrity Game also means wholeness and strength, like the integrity of a bridge for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each question helps initiate personal growth, building emotional strength and agility while having fun. Included in the book is everything you need to play, just add your dice and timer. (Eight-sided belt colored dice and sand timer also available.) Using a martial arts theme, players graduate from white belt, with a very slim chance of controversy, on up to black belt, which has the highest chance of controversy. Also included is a journal with Ki in Aikido concepts to grow inner strength as you go through the week. Ki is also known as Chi as in Tai Chi and is used in martial arts for effective practices in presence power.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-italic">&nbsp;When you think about conversations on the internet and social media, you might think of the lost connections due to religion and politics. While we want to keep things light, the only things that are really interesting are deep and meaningful conversations as well as funny light hearted play. This game offers both fun comedy and meaningful conversation, getting to know each other carefully as we go deeper into important subjects.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Shoujiki, pronounced (sho jee kee) is the Japanese word for honesty or integrity.</p>
<p>Integrity in <span class="text-italic">The Shoujiki Method </span>is not only honesty, but it’s also wholeness and strength, like the integrity of a bridge for example.</p>
<p>Included in the book is everything you need to play, just add your dice and timer. (A deluxe coffee table version with a hardwood case, playing cards, eight-sided belt colored dice and sand timer also available as a reward.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using a martial arts theme, players graduate from white belt, with a very slim chance of controversy, on up to black belt, which has the highest chance of controversy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players start with easy white belt questions then move through the ranks to more controversial questions. A Sensei or Teacher is appointed as a moderator at the start of the game. Sensei decides if and when players are in good humor and ready to advance up the ranks. Rank is as follows; white, yellow, green, blue, brown and black. Beginner's mind throughout the process means that players stay open, light-hearted and allow for differences to advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping a beginners mind, players allow for differences. The concept of beginner’s mind is common in martial arts. Not knowing anything, you’re open and ready to learn. When you already know everything, you are too filled up with no room for more information. In this game we assume nothing and set knowledge aside, opening up to other's opinions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In class black belts worked with real knives, so in higher belts the questions are meant to be edgy. Moving too quickly through the ranks is not recommended before knowing each other’s tolerances.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="bold">Benefits of The Shoujiki Method</span></p>
<p>A dojo is a place of martial arts practice. There, manners and etiquette are a priority so that the sensei can help students learn without injury. Wouldn’t it be nice if we all used dojo etiquette in conversation?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if people from diverse backgrounds gathering together entered a conversation with courtesy, like a bow of respect?</p>
<p>This martial arts theme supports cooperation and prevents escalating conflict. The Sensei moderates as players ask increasingly in depth questions. With a good sense of humor, players can move up the ranks. With interesting topic prompts through question cards, this game makes conversations enjoyable, safe, and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friendly Chibi animals represent the lighthearted, child-like mood necessary to level up. The goal is to share honestly, while maintaining good humor, integrity, and compassion for differences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players start by choosing a sensei (this should be someone easy-going). Sensei will act as the moderator and choose a question from the white belt cards. Sensei shows how it's done by answering the first question. Sensei also awards higher belts to players as they progress. As one advances, they keep their rank for the next game, but the questions still begin with a white belt lightness.</p>
<p>This method brings attention to how others perceive us and how we see the world around us by asking the right questions, but with a sense of humor as the focus.</p>
<p>I remember years ago when I was a blue belt, my sensei was training us and noticed the serious look on my face as I practiced. To keep my mood light, he said, “Do the movement again, but this time with your tongue hanging out to the side.” My partner and I tried our best to focus on technique without laughing. We also tried not to bite our tongues.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-italic">The Shoujiki Method</span> is designed to take us to the next level in our relationships. Just by listening to each other, we get a better idea of where we are, and where we want to go next.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, throughout the process of this game creation, I wanted to give up. “It’s too hard, it will cause fights,” and so on. Then I would feel a spiritual tug on my heart to keep going.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today’s high-tech climate, there is something missing. So many distractions such as busy lives, phone checking, sharp and polarized opinions, and more are causing separations among us. We are awakening to the need to gather together in the flesh, in a safe environment of trust and connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;While social media keeps us connected to friends and family in some ways, <span class="text-italic">The Shoujiki Method</span> fills in the gaps of our craving for true relationship.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Conversational Balance</span></p>
<p>Balance is a problem in any group, so in our martial arts classes, we used a “talking stick.” Whoever had it would speak, and no one could interrupt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, the dice work like the talking stick. Whoever has the dice, has the floor, but the number of words they can use are limited by the number rolled on the dice. This encourages an even playing field where everyone speaks up, but only with a few words at a time. When someone has trouble articulating their thoughts and feelings in the right amount of words, this method encourages other players to join in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where your sense of humor guides the group, building a sense of mutual trust.</p>
<p>With the help of a moderator, or sensei, the players and their many diverse perspectives can be protected from judgment and conflict. There’s nothing like gathering around the table, picking up the benefits of genuine face-to-face interaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sitting with other people, there is a radiation of energy that becomes obvious with repeated practice. In class, we called this “the feeling.” As we approached our partners in technique, for example, we would sense their intentions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feeling cannot be conveyed by phone, email, or social media. Becoming sensitive to it through noticing little things like micro-expressions or body language, is a strength. If you can do this while staying light, you’ll have an amazing conversational advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listening with compassion for differences provides a mirror for other people to see and hear themselves more clearly. They may realize for the first time whether they come across as interesting or intolerant, for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I was talking about creating a cartoon with the creatures in the <span class="text-italic">Shoujiki Integrity Game.</span> I think it would be helpful for kids to have positive role models.</p>
<p>In this cartoon, Chibi animals would be martial arts students with a light glowing inside them. It would glow stronger when they absorbed a life lesson from their Sensei. Each character would also have powers. Bonnie Bunny would thump, filling the room with calming golden sparkles. Rascal Raccoon would put on his mask and see through lies and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I mentioned that I wanted only soothing voices in the cartoon, unlike another popular kid’s cartoon, this enraged a child who overheard me. He loved that cartoon. He calmed down only after I explained that not liking what he likes doesn’t mean I don’t like <span class="text-italic">him</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book is complete and you can play by adding dice and a 30-second timer. I also have &nbsp;7 polygon 8-sided dice with graduated belt colors as well as a sand timer available. Other components such as playing cards are on the way, but questions and pictures are also in the book.</p>
<p>You who are teachers, mentors, spiritual leaders, and people who just enjoy connection, can help other people just by listening. Questions are designed to go straight to what matters, making a positive difference after just one session. However talented you may be in conversation, there is always room for improvement, so, playing Shoujiki will continually elevate your inner strength, humor and agility.</p>
