<p>Shadow Profiteer is a one-shot adventure for the fifth edition of the world’s greatest role-playing game. Upon the players entering into a sleepy little town, it is quickly overtaken by a bizarre fog. As people come in contact with this fog, they become afflicted with a hideous malady that turns them into murderous husks of their former selves, rampaging and killing anything living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As members of an adventuring group, the players are recruited by a mysterious mage working to find a man within the town who may know more about their current plight, and to rescue him, if necessary, so they can prevent this unknown malevolence from sweeping through the nation.</p>
<p>Shadow Profiteer is designed to be played in a single gaming session, or if you want an exciting and spooky mystery to add to your existing campaign. It is scaled for four to six players from 1st through 4th level, although it could be easily modified to play up to 7th level.</p>

<h3 id="h:it-is-a-world-on-the" class="page-anchor">&nbsp;<span class="text-italic">It is a world on the brink of an industrial revolution, and yet alive and thriving with magic…</span>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Seven hundred winters ago, the Warlord stormed across southern Kuldarr, at war with the nation of Malten. Using an army of massive humans known as Wilders, he operated with ruthless guerilla tactics, capturing or crippling areas of vital interest. To do this, he formed special units for unique missions – one such unit was designated the Aphotic.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of the Aphotic was to work in the shadows, doing the dark jobs that history prefers to gloss over. After the Warlord’s demise, the Aphotic simply vanished. However, the truth is that the Aphotic received one last mission to carry out, one not found in any texts, and they failed.</p>
<p>The Warlord knew he was losing the war. He needed allies. The elves, however, refused to support either side, calling it a “human affair.” So, he sent the Aphotic to lay waste to the High Province’s major crop distribution points, and if that failed to sufficiently rile them, then they were to assassinate the Queen.</p>
<p>Only, the Aphotic didn’t make it. They were not only defeated, but also cast out of the very world, fading into dust and memory.</p>
<p>Now, on a recent excavation of an ancient battle site, Manceologist Morgan Rechls has discovered what looks to be a broken tablet used to project into the In-Between plane. It is actually the missing codex of the Aphotic. When Morgan Rechls returns to his home in Somnolence, the other piece of the broken codex thrums to life. The mysterious owner is aware of the tale of the Aphotic and sees the possibility of great fortune in the ensuing chaos of war that the codex will cause if he activates his piece of the codex.</p>
<p>The Aphotic are back, and they know nothing of how the times have changed. They do not know that the war is over, and these once-banished spirits are ready to fulfill the tasks they swore to complete so long ago…</p>
<p>Somnolence is about to face an invasion from something beyond their very comprehension – magical creatures from the In-Between itself. One group of adventurers just happens to be in Somnolence. They are all that stands between the Aphotic and their ability to plunge the nation of High Province into war.</p>

<p>Play in an odd little town within a very familiar-feeling fantasy nation. This initial entry is loaded with possibility. It is full of interesting side stories, adventure ideas, unique personalities, and player immersion. The players get the option to play with eccentric pre-generated characters complete with their own personalities and backgrounds. Or, they can play as a new race, with a new background to dabble with against an unknown threat. There's always a feeling of tension in the air, time is swiftly running out – the Queen, and even the very nation, is at stake should you fail.</p>
<p>This adventure module was a hard decision for our team to decide upon. At our core we long to unleash you fully into the world of the Blood Wizard Chronicles, to immerse you into a fantasy world where nobility is losing its control to the rise of industry and corporations, and where both will do whatever it takes to hold that power. It is a place where technology and magic are evenly matched, where even the smallest person may make a mark upon the world. Ultimately though, budget won out (or lack thereof), and we opted to let you first step into a small sliver of our world – and should you like where you are, we will gladly give you more!</p>

<p>As fans of Kickstarter, we have backed quite a few projects, primarily games. We at Halsbren Publishing are also huge fans of RPGs and have been playing and GMing them for over 20 years (one of us 30+ years). We chose this platform to see if the Blood Wizard Chronicles world of Kuldarr garners interest as a campaign setting.</p>
<p>It is our hope to have an overarching campaign setting that runs tandem with Jay Erickson’s novel series. But since this is our first Kickstarter, we wanted to do something smaller and more introductory. We are keeping the reward costs modest, and the funding goal as low as possible, in an effort to introduce the world of Kuldarr to a wider audience. We hope you enjoy our product.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">Halsbren Publishing has been publishing fantasy novels for the last 5 years, as well as a previous adventure module for the 3.5 OGL. In this regard, we are very confident in the layout, formatting, and publishing of our product. That said, this is the first Kickstarter that we have run. That means that there is a degree of uncertainty for us when it comes to the fulfillment process. We’ve chosen a manufacturer of the physical products that has a great track record with crowdfunding and game production to help us through those potential hurdles.
 
We've been careful to keep this Kickstarter campaign as simple as possible to ensure that we can deliver all the rewards at a level of quality that we can be proud of. All of the initial artwork and writing for the adventure module has been completed, as well as extensive playtesting. But we want the best for our backers, and upon completion of this campaign, it will go through a rigorous editing and layout process, as well as some final touches on the playtesting end of things, pending stretch goal additions. To this end we gave ourselves a little wiggle room for our delivery dates. We hope to be done and have the product shipped and in your hands long before that deadline, though. Our stretch goals were designed so that we can produce and deliver them in as quick and as timely a manner as possible.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/halsbrenpublishing/the-shadow-profiteer/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
