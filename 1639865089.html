<h1 id="h:big-bad-con-2019" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Big Bad Con 2019</span></h1>
<p>From its original goal of simply giving the best possible gaming experience to our local gaming community, Big Bad Con has taken its community-building vision closer to heart every year. And every edition has attracted new people who have helped us move in that direction, like a big katamari of awesome. Big Bad Con has become a transformative event that connects people together and builds communities while ensuring that we hold space for folks from marginalized groups and amplify their voices.</p>
<p>This year, we realized that this goal required a more direct effort. We partnered with DC, who launched the <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/babble-on-equity-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babble On Equity Project</a> as a separate fundraising effort to bring more people of color to Big Bad Con. BEOP was amazingly successful! In just two days, it had surpassed its funding goal, and will be able to bring over 30 people to Big Bad Con. Now we’re more excited than ever to make Big Bad Con 2019 the best it’s ever been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every one of you who buys a badge, makes a pledge, or donates to the scholarship fund is an intrinsic part of making this happen. You form the foundation for not just the awesomeness of the weekend convention but the larger mission of Big Bad Con to make the tabletop and larp community a more inclusive and welcoming space for all.</p>

Obstacles we've encountered in the past include the room blocks filling up, unexpected charges from the hotel rooms, t-shirts trapped in FedEx facilities, fires blocking access to the con, lack of food options, hotel rooms becoming unsuitable for use, and last-minute GM cancellations.

While each of these has been a challenge, we've always pulled through. We’ve incorporated as a nonprofit 501c3, expanded our room blocks, navigated through tough hotel negotiations, and called on an array of excellent GMs to run games in a pinch!

I'm confident we can tackle any obstacles that come our way in 2019. We want to deliver the best roleplaying convention experience with you and for you!</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/1157274964/big-bad-con-2019/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
