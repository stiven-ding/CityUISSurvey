<h1 id="h:magical-creatures-mo" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Magical Creatures, Monsters, and Beasts</span></h1>
<p>We love magical creatures, awesome beasts, amazing cryptids, and fantastic monsters. We're fascinated by their features, abilities, and attributes. We always want more creatures, from the cute and cuddly to the outright bizarre to the fearsome foes. If you're nodding along and you play the 5th edition of the oldest and largest tabletop roleplaying game or Pathfinder, this project is for you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're a GM, you probably have scoured the D&amp;D and Pathfinder bestiaries and used many of the creatures and monsters in your dungeons. As a player, you've perhaps grown accustomed to owlbears, wraiths, trolls, mimics, or gelatinous cubes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ready for some new creatures to encounter in your campaigns? Unique and never-before-seen ones, or new, magical versions of some of your favorites?&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were, too, which led to developing a few new creatures for our magical universe, Magimundi. We started with the idea of making a magical zoology textbook, and then we got the fever. Some 100 creatures later, we are still churning out new ones. &nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:unique-and-creative" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Unique &amp; Creative Creatures&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>Do your campaigns ever get into a rut? Do players encounter a monster and attack, vanquish, and loot without a second thought? Maybe you'd like your party to do more than kill creatures. Perhaps not every encounter ends in combat? Maybe you even want to toss in something a bit more lighthearted? We did, too, and that is why you'll find creatures here from the whimsical and even comical all the way to the terribly fearsome and truly monstrous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you like reading bestiaries for fun? Do you like browsing beautiful color illustrations of fantastic creatures and magical beasts? We do, too, and we wanted to create a gorgeous book that you'll enjoy reading through again and again. With the help of incredible artists such as Ffion Evans and Dagmara Gaska, we think you'll love the artwork as much as we do.</p>

<p>Some people love books and flipping to a page. Others prefer keyword searching and pulling up e-books on their mobile devices. Many people want both!</p>
<p>We're creating both searchable PDF and print editions, so you can have your preference. If you opt for a softcover edition or a hardcover special edition, we'll also give you the corresponding fully illustrated, complete text PDF as well. We know you use them for different things. Access your bestiary from a mobile device or keep your paper copy at the table.&nbsp;</p>

<h1 id="h:setting-agnostic" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Setting-Agnostic</span></h1>
<p>These creatures were created for the Magimundi, a magical universe. We're not ready to release that as a full setting (YET), but we've been bringing these creatures to the table in Pathfinder and 5e for almost three years now. We've added them to traditional fantasy settings, and also to sci-fi, cyberpunk, and post-apocalyptic campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever you need an unusual monster, add in one of these, no matter your setting. We've categorized them for your campaigns, from environment and habitat to size and level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can easily have a portal open to another world, the Magimundi, and have a reason for never-before-seen creatures and beasts to arrive!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen to a sample of how it might go in your campaign!</p>

<p>We've organized our Bestiary like the Pathfinder or 5e bestiaries you're accustomed to using, so it's even easier to use. You'll find:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Short description, type, and level</li>
  <li>Hit points, skills, and attributes</li>
  <li>Special attacks and defenses</li>
  <li>Terrain and habitat</li>
  <li>Size</li>

<p>Creatures are aerial, aquatic, undead, spectral, land-based, insects, mammals, fish, and hybrids thereof. Some are fierce and ferocious. Others are a nuisance. Still others will confound and delight you with their attributes and components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You likely wonâ€™t be more than slowed down or distracted by Snipe or feel a stamina and intelligence drain from encountering a Bisonatee. But should your party encounter an undead Chupacabra known as the Grunch, you had better have a formidable plan and an excellent healer.</p>
<h1 id="h:full-color-full-body" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Full Color, Full Body Illustrations Throughout</span></h1>
<p>Every creature is illustrated with full-body, full-color artwork drawn, inked, and painted by Ffion Evans. Ffionâ€™s attention to anatomy and her eye for both the creepy and the whimsical brings these cryptids, creatures, chimera, and legends to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cover art and additional paintings are done by Dagmara Gaska, who has also illustrated for major game, fantasy, and science fiction publishers. Dagmaraâ€™s paintings bring together the horror of fearsome beasts and the heroes who vanquish them.&nbsp;</p>

<h1 id="h:our-developer-team" class="page-anchor">Our Developer Team</h1>
<p>In addition to the folks above, we had an entire team of 5th Edition and Pathfinder players and GMs work on developing creatures for each bestiary. These folks have many decades of combined experience playing and GMing, and you'll be excited by the creative ways they've expressed these creatures. Super unique combinations of abilities and skills to challenge and surprised adventuring parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working on Pathfinder were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>David Neubauer (team lead, development coordinator)</li>
  <li>Daniel Abraham</li>
  <li>Marquis Maddox</li>
  <li>Eric Schiller</li>
  <li>Caleb Brannan</li>
  <li>Austin Shepherd</li>
  <li>Ben Morrow</li>
</ul>
<p>Working on D&amp;D 5th Edition were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jason Arne</li>
  <li>Sharang Biswas</li>
  <li>W. Ryan Carden</li>
  <li>Clio Yun-Su Davis</li>
  <li>Elizabeth DeLyser</li>
  <li>Brandon Hare&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have had some amazing editorial and project management help from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tara M. Clapper</li>
  <li>Shayna Cook</li>
  <li>Lee Parmenter</li>
  <li>Anna Yardney</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks also to our awesome playtesters, who provided us with great feedback about where attributes were under or overpowered, performed strangely, or ate entire parties. Thanks, in particular, to Damian Van Hart, who tested creatures many times.</p>
<p>We couldn't have done this without all of these awesome developers and contributors.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">We've done fairly well creating a magical world and exploring it through live roleplay and other books. There is a large fanbase for Pathfinder 1.0 and D&amp;D 5e -- we are part of those fans as well! So our goal was to cross these streams and put our beasts in those games. 

The artwork for all of the base creatures for the book is already in hand and the artists paid, and the creature descriptions have been written, balanced, and edited. We are using Kickstarter to fund the graphic design and printing of the books, reach more people, and fund additional artwork for covers and backdrops. 

Together, our team has deep experience with Kickstarter campaigns, publishing, and gameplay. We are using either Drive-Thru RPG or Mixam printing, depending on the quantities revealed in the Kickstarter. Both organizations are very familiar with printing and delivering RPG books. Weâ€™ve built in some extra time to account for any delays in proofs and shipping, but the project is in its final stages and with the slate of partners involved, it should run like clockwork. Of course, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen weather events or other disasters that can affect logistics and delivery, but weâ€™ve tried to account for potential delays and oddities so that we can deliver on time. We want the book in our hands as much as you do! 

Shipping is always a variable, and weâ€™re collecting shipping costs through BackerKit separately so that more accurate costs can be determined, depending on the location of the backer, which printer we ultimately use, and the shipping charges and tariffs in place at the time. Since we've been responsible for managing 15 Kickstarters between us, we've been bitten by shipping issues in the past. As a result, we are being especially careful and transparent.

Barring any challenges, we expect to be able to fulfill the campaign in early November, with plenty of time for holiday gift-giving.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/inexorablemedia/magimundi-bestiary-new-monsters-for-5e-or-pathfinder/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
