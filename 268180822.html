I think a lot of us have. You have a specific adventure in mind, but you aren't sure how to do it - what system to use, what sort-of characters. So you pick a system that you're familiar with and force the adventure into that mold. And that works okay. But once in a while you say F it and write up your own thing: your own set of rules for the weird little side-trip into fantasy land that you want to make. And maybe that works better, or maybe not, but you remember what fun it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done that more times than I can count. Rare Birds is one of them. It's an effort to make a really flexible system with guideposts that help the storyteller/GM tell the story. And it gives a player with even very limited gaming experience a number of handles on their character, in plain language.&nbsp;There are also some optional player-side narrative tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm taking the games I've run like that, in that system, and I'm putting them together for you. See what you think. &nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">I have some design choices to make. I've run this system using different number scales in the past, and I'll need to narrow things down and exclude a few things in order to present a sensible whole. Sometimes editing things down is tough for me. But I can do it! This isn't a huge project. It's just a few pages of rules, some characters, and a scenario. That's the sort of thing I routinely do for a convention or a group of friends in a couple of weeks.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/412260577/rare-birds/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
