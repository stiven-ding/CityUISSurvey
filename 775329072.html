<p><span class="bold">What's in the box:</span></p>
<p>In each box, you'll receive the board, 55 playing cards, player pieces, and a die. Cups, balls, and quarters not included.</p>
<p><span class="bold">How to play:</span></p>
<p><span class="text-italic">The basic premise:</span></p>
<p>Players take turns rolling the die. After each roll, advance your piece by the number rolled. If you land on the same spot as other players, you MUST high five all players on that spot (this is very important). If you land on a marked spot, pull a card. Do what the card says. If the card is a challenge card, complete the challenge. If you win the challenge, cross the bridge to the right. If you lose the challenge, cross the bridge to the left. Upon completing the board, you must win one final challenge to win the game (You don‚Äôt have to land on the last space exactly, you can go over).</p>

<p><span class="text-italic">To the victor go the spoils:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Upon winning the game, you may name a spot after yourself. Write the name of the spot on the board in pen or permanent marker. Yeah, go ahead, it‚Äôs staying there forever. You earned it baby! Make a rule for when people land on your spot (some examples below). Every time you win, you may add one decoration to your spot so everyone knows how awesome you are.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-italic">Example rules:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>The last player to touch their nose incurs a "house rules" penalty.</li>
  <li>Do the running man.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Text my significant other something random without any context.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Do a cart wheel.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Do your best Chewbacca impression.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="text-italic">Explanation of select cards and challenges (not all cards listed):</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Any cup: throw a ping pong ball into any cup in a 10-cup triangle&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Pick your 3 cup triangle: throw a ping pong ball into any cup in a 3-cup triangle</li>
  <li>Call your cup: throw a ping pong ball into a single cup you choose</li>
  <li>Flip cup: put your cup on the table with the bottom down. Flip the cup so it lands with its top on the table</li>
  <li>Quarters: bounce a quarter into a cup</li>
  <li>Heads up challenge: pick someone to play against head-to-head</li>
  <li>Group challenge: everyone participates. If the person who pulled the card comes in first, they cross the bridge forward. If that person comes in last (or last two in a game of five or more people), they cross the bridge backwards. Anything else, and they stay where they are. You must come in first in a group challenge to win the game. Anything else is considered a loss, and you must go back to the first blue square</li>
  <li>JACKASS: immediately go backwards. Incur a penalty.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Misery likes company: boy this one‚Äôs a real mother f*cker... you and one other player of your choosing must start the game over <span class="text-italic">(sucks to suck)</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="text-italic">On entering/exiting the game:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>People can join mid-game and just start from the beginning.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If people have to leave for a bit, just leave their piece and let them resume playing when they come back. It‚Äôs a party. Go party. Then come back after you get shot down. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
  <li>If you‚Äôre not around when it‚Äôs your turn, other players are welcome to skip you - depends how nice your friends are I guess.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="text-italic">Other stuff:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>If someone rolls the die off the table, other players are encouraged to ‚Äúhiss‚Äù at the rolling player expressing their dissatisfaction over the sloppy roll.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If you don‚Äôt win your challenge or if you pull a WHAMMY on the final space, move back to the first blue square.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>There are only 8 player pieces in the box, but there‚Äôs really no limit to the number of people allowed to play- it‚Äôs a party game and meant to be inclusive (i.e. don‚Äôt be a dick). Feel free to use whatever is lying around for extra pieces: bottle caps, starbursts, gum wrappers, chap stick.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>So, you decided to play with a starburst and someone ate your piece. This is allowed, but the player whose piece was eaten is allowed to bitch and moan for a bit and resume playing after finding a new piece to play with.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the following sequence is rolled, the first player to put their left shoe on their head wins the game: 2.2.2.6</li>
  <li>Are you still reading this?&nbsp;Just go buy the game.</li>
  <li>Feel free to interpret the rules as you see fit. This is a big ‚Äúhouse rules‚Äù sort of game.</li>
  <li>It can also be helpful to have a ‚Äúgame master‚Äù - someone to move the game along, help rack cups, and settle any disputes, like who finished flipping their cup first.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If you can‚Äôt play one of the games (for example, if you don‚Äôt have any quarters), feel free to replace that given game with another or just pull another card. Totally your call.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Finally, If you‚Äôre complaining about the rules you can f*ck off because this is meant to be a fun game.*</li>
</ul>
<p>*unless someone eats your piece in which case limited complaining is permitted</p>
