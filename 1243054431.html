<p>We're creating a role playing game. &nbsp;A game designed based on choices our backers vote for. &nbsp;Backers will decide the game mechanic, genre and races.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep reading, support the campaign and buckle up because its going to be a wild ride!</p>
<h1 id="h:what-the-h-ll" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">What the H*LL?!?!&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>The fine folks at KickStarter asked for people to create new types of campaigns as part of the "Break KickStarter" promotion <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">so we're doing just that!</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is more than the game development and art, this is a month long social event! &nbsp;Take to social media and advocate for your choices. Convince others to pledge and cast their votes to support what you want Broken! to be.&nbsp;You can only pledge/vote once but don't let that stop you from swaying others to join the campaign and help us to create a truly unique RPG. &nbsp;Let's get everyone involved!!</p>
<h1 id="h:how-does-this-work" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">How does this work?</span></h1>
<p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">For starters, everyone pledging at a tier gets the game</span></span>. &nbsp;We'll push out play test version first (digital, PDF) by December of this year and revise as needed to arrive at the completed game (estimated to be done by July 2020). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the play test period is over, the game content will get revised into finished product stage. &nbsp;All backers will receive their PDF for that version and print on demand codes for use through drivethrurpg.com so you can order a print copy. &nbsp;The print on demand code will allow you to purchase the book at the print on demand print cost (same price I pay to have them printed through drivethrurpg) plus your shipping. &nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:how-are-you-going-to" class="page-anchor">How are you going to make this?</h1>
<p>This is going to be the hardest bit of game development I've ever done. &nbsp;Here's how its going to work, so pay attention everyone, this is how the decisions are made and Broken! gets created.</p>
<h1 id="h:phase-one" class="page-anchor"><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Phase One&nbsp;</span></span></h1>
<p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">You pick the tier you want to pledge to. </span></span>We have three categories of voting tiers: Tiers that reflect what game mechanic, tiers that reflect genre and tiers that reflect what types of races we're incorporating. &nbsp;<span class="bold">Pledge at the tier that is most important to you in the game's development.</span></p>
<h1 id="h:phase-two" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Phase Two :</span></h1>
<p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Advocate for your choice.</span></span>&nbsp;This is how <span class="bold">Broken!</span> will get funded and made. &nbsp;We're calling on all backers to take to social media (don't pay for ads or boosting posts, we're just talking about normal posts/tweets/etc) &nbsp;and tell folks why your choice is right for what Broken! will become. &nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the word and your own influence to help make Broken! the RPG that truly represents what the TTRPG community wants.</p>
<p>During the campaign I (W.S. "Sam" Quinton... you know, the guy in the video) will be frequently live streaming to promote this campaign. &nbsp;I invite you to do the same and, if you do, invite me on and if I can make it I will! &nbsp;Note that if multiple people request the same date/time the first person requesting will have priority regardless of how big your audience is. &nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:phase-three" class="page-anchor"><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Phase Three :</span></span></h1>
<p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Step One:</span></span></p>
<p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">When the campaign ends we'll tally the votes.</span></span> &nbsp;The tier with the most pledges (votes) will determine which tier choice is used in game development. &nbsp;{Example: &nbsp;If 2000 people pledge for 5E OGL game mechanic and 2 pledge for M.A.R.S then 5E will be the game mechanic used in the game}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the campaign is done we'll begin the design and release our play test version in PDF to all backers (Estimated release of play test version is December 2019). &nbsp;Play the game, tell us what is good and what sucks. &nbsp;Post comments here on the page so we (and the whole world) can see them. &nbsp;We'll take that information and refine the content into the final version of the game. &nbsp;The PDF file will be updated along the way as we work toward a final version.</p>
<p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Step Two:</span></span></p>
<p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Once the final version is done</span></span>, we'll update the PDF release to the final version which means you'll get it automatically through drivethrurpg. &nbsp;&nbsp;We'll then release the print on demand codes here for all backers. &nbsp;There will be two codes released (one for soft cover and one for hard cover) and each will be valid for all backers. &nbsp;</p>

<h1 id="h:backer-rewards" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Backer Rewards:&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p><span class="bold">All Backers </span>will receive the game. We will be sending PDF versions of the play test edition out first (targeting December of 2019) and will update that to the final release version (targeting July 2020). &nbsp;When we release the final release version we will post print on demand codes (redeemed through drivethrurpg.com) for both a soft cover and hard cover edition of the Broken! RPG. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're keeping the tiers as low as we can (and still have a hope of funding) so we're counting on YOU to spread the word to help make <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Broken!</span></span> what you want it to be!</p>
<h1 id="h:how-much-content-are" class="page-anchor">How much content are we talking about here?</h1>
<p>By reaching our goal we'll have:</p>
<p>A full color cover, 12 full page color illustrations / and 12 line art illustrations (gear and monster examples) created by Zachary Viola.</p>
<p>12 Full color character illustrations created by Lotus Blair.</p>
<p>Full color maps by Tania Gomes.</p>
<p>A complete game we'll squeeze into around 160 pages (or more) in a 6 x 9 inch digest size. This is an estimate based on previous work done on other titles that are currently in development, but it is a good one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bold">Will it suck at first?</span> &nbsp;Probably, but that's what play testing is for. &nbsp;I'll be listening to your feedback, <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">and then work to fix BROKEN!</span></span> so that it plays smoothly and is a fun for all of us. &nbsp;That's the goal. That's why we're here.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="h:stretch-goals" class="page-anchor">Stretch Goals</h1>
<p>Let's face it, stretch goals are fun and exciting. &nbsp;Our stretch goals are meant to be fun, to provide added value for all backers, and to help encourage more folks to contribute to this project.&nbsp; Fulfillment dates of stretch goals will be determined and released during development of <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Broken!</span></span> (we will be giving you the most accurate project release timeline that way).</p>
<p>All stretch goals will be fulfilled with all tiers receiving PDF and Print on Demand codes (both for use through drivethrurpg.com). &nbsp;That's right, <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">everyone who pledges at a tier</span></span> will get Broken! plus any and all unlocked stretch goals. &nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h1 id="h:30000-a-fractured-wo" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">$30000 ~ A Fractured World&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>Reaching this level of funding we will produce a source book describing the world setting of Broken! in detail, whatever that setting may be. &nbsp;We'll begin development alongside the creation of the game so that everything fits well together.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:45000-shattered-the" class="page-anchor">$45000 ~ Shattered! &nbsp;the first supplement book for Broken!</h1>
<p>Shattered! Will be a source book focused on lost lore. &nbsp;This is where we put the secret stuff, neat items, relics you want to quest after and bad guys who are working behind the scenes.</p>
<h1 id="h:60000-in-pieces" class="page-anchor">$60000 ~ In Pieces</h1>
<p>Reaching this level of funding we'll be producing "In Pieces" the first adventure for our new RPG.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond that... thank you for your support. &nbsp;We'll be doing our utmost to produce a fun game for all of us. &nbsp;Additional funding is appreciated and will be used responsibly to produce the best work possible while paying fair wages for contributing artists, writers and designers.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h1 id="h:where-does-the-money" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Where does the money go?</span></h1>
<p><span class="bold">Development 90%: </span>Money raised from this campaign will be used to pay artists, writers, art director and editor. &nbsp;This campaign has been streamlined to pay for creation, while paying a fair wage to folks working on the project.&nbsp; Backer rewards are easy to fulfill and forego charging for shipping during the KickStarter campaign which helps to keep our overall goal lower.</p>
<p><span class="bold">KickStarter fees/copyright/legal expenses 10%</span>: The mundane part of game development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These figures have been rounded for simplicity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h1 id="h:why-do-you-need-a-15" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Why do you need a $15000 goal?</span></h1>
<p>We're funding this project completely from the proceeds of this KickStarter campaign. &nbsp;All the art, writing, editing, art direction, copyright filing and all other costs are being paid for by this campaign. &nbsp;There is a LOT of art being commissioned specifically for this project and a lot of design, writing and editing to be done. &nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h1 id="h:break-kickstarter" class="page-anchor">Break KickStarter!</h1>
<p>This is a fun project idea that we are taking to heart. &nbsp;We don't yet know what the finished product will look like, but we DO know that it will have a little bit of each of you within it. &nbsp;So pledge your $5 to cast your vote, tune in for updates, post LOTS of comments and questions and help us to <span class="bold">Break KickStarter</span> with <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Broken!</span></span></p>
<br>
<h1 id="h:we-need-3000-or-more" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">We need 3000 or more backers to fund this project!</span></h1>
<p>This campaign flies in the face of TTRPG crowdfunding convention. &nbsp;There are NO high value tiers, no add-ons, no Gimmicks. &nbsp;The ONLY thing that will make this project succeed is if enough people want a new game and want to have their say about how it is developed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority rules with this campaign so post about the campaign often and advocate for your own choice. &nbsp;Please, lets be civil about this everyone. &nbsp;It is after all, a game and we want everyone to have fun with it.</p>

Really, there are a number of things that can cause problems for this project.  So lets look at what we can do to make things run as smoothly as possible.  

 I've run and fulfilled successful campaigns before and I'm confident that we've identified some key risks.

1) Writing ~ quality writing takes time.  If contributing writers miss deadlines we will see delays.  For this purpose I'm doing most of the writing myself and commissioning writing from industry writers known to me.

2) Art delays ~ If something happens to delay Zack or Lotus in art development it will work against the timeline.  Zack and Lotus are the principle artists on this project.  If need be we can bring on other artists for illustrations to be included in meeting Stretch Goals.  To be honest though, I've NEVER had either of them miss a deadline.  Ever.

3) Delayed response to contribution inquiries and backer surveys.  This is a big one!  We'll be collecting data very quickly so as to begin work on the project.  Don't delay, answer your backer survey quickly so we can get your information in for PDF distribution so you can be playing Broken! when the play test version first goes out!

4) Participation:  This campaign is dependent upon backer involvement.  We not only want your feedback after the play test version goes out, we really and truly NEED it!  Please post comments to the main campaign page addressing any concerns, game play problems or other "this sucks" kind of development problems.  We'll work to fix the problems in Broken! before final release in order to create the best game possible.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/sinopapublishing/broken-a-break-kickstarter-created-ttrpg/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
