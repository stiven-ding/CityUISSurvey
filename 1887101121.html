<p>Laura Danowski is living out her dreams in Hollywood and also a Toronto native. Laura has been performing for just over 13 years now and has found her passion in the sketch comedy world. Laura has can be seen on the hit show Trailer Park Boys and is a regular on Swear Net TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark and Laura's Story:</p>
<p>We met almost 12 years ago in Toronto at Humber College. We have been on countless shows together and have always made each other laugh, one night in Hollywood (name dropping) I (Mark) pitched Laura on an idea for a card game, Laura loved it and since that point we have been figuring out how this can be more than just another idea that never went anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward one year and we have 2 prototype decks made and I (Mark) get a call from Laura almost in tears telling me that she was playing CRY ME A RIVER on a patio and people around her started asking what she was playing. Next thing she knew THE WHOLE PATIO was playing the game and everyone exchanged numbers and ended up becoming friends. It was at this point we both knew there was something about this game that not only is a good ice breaker but brings people together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have played this game with so many people and they all love how simple it is, it's really what makes it the perfect game to throw in your purse, bag or pocket and bring it to a night out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why we are doing a KickStarer Campaign:</p>
<p>Like most people we do need the money, there are no hidden agenda's with that. Our goal will allow us to buy 250 decks and do some online advertising this will allow us to start our lives as entrepreneurs. That's it, we are not making any money from this, it is just to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>How we are going to advertise:</p>
<p>I (Mark) am starting a tour across Canada and I have decided instead of selling "merch" after my stand up shows I will spread the word of Cry me a River. I truly believe this game can be something that people will have a lot of fun playing and if I can bring joy in their lives after they see my stand up &nbsp;I'm happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also being doing social media advertising which will come from the campaign and our own pockets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future of CRY ME A RIVER:</p>
<p>The complete first edition deck will be 52 cards, we would like to release countless expansion packs and hire/pay comedians to come up with their own expansion packs. Once the expansion packs are release you will be able to add them to the original deck and create more problem-matic scenarios.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">The game is so simple that our biggest risk is not hitting our financial goal to get the game some what mass printed. We have the cards already designed and would pay to have a graphic artist create a proper logo for us. These challenges are already in line to be taken care of, just comes down to the funds.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/crymeariver/cry-me-a-river/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
