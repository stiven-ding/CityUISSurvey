 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stadium Dice (working title) is a competitive die dropping/tossing/throwing game in which you and your team of Gladiators (your dice) try to outscore the other teams of Gladiators (the other players' dice) in an ancient Roman stadium.</p>

 <span class="bold">Basic Gameplay:</span>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each player selects a team of Gladiators with which to do battle (a set of 10 like-colored dice).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players take turns entering Gladiators, 1 at a time, into the arena by dropping, tossing or throwing the die into the field of battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each entry may be used to attempt to manipulate the other Gladiators that are already on the field.&nbsp; Players may choose to try and better their own score, or reduce another player's score.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first player to go in a round has a disadvantage being first, and the last player has an advantage (like in bocce or shuffleboard), so a round is played for each player to have a turn being first and last (i.e. 4 players = 4 rounds). &nbsp;The Gladiators are scored based on the top side of the die, plus the effect of any modifiers they touch on the arena floor.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player with the highest score wins!</p>

<h1 id="h:is-it-hard-to-play" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Is it hard to play?</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all! &nbsp;If you can throw dice, you can play! &nbsp;Of course, if you can't do math yet, you may need a little help with scoring. &nbsp;This is one of those games that is simple to learn, but provides plenty of opportunity for skill, strategy and - best of all - sabotage! &nbsp;It is the game's easy but elusive qualities that make it so addictive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During playtesting at a board game convention, a couple of interesting and wonderful things happened. &nbsp;In one incident, a woman placed the game on the floor and played with her toddler. &nbsp;The child couldn’t keep score or employ strategy, but had a blast throwing the dice while she learned about following instructions and taking turns during gameplay. &nbsp;In another game, I saw some American college guys playing against a girl and her parents. &nbsp;They were all laughing together and having fun. &nbsp;The great aspect of this particular game is that the girl’s parents didn’t speak English, but this didn’t keep them all from playing together and having fun! &nbsp;It was evident that age and language aren’t barriers to enjoying Stadium Dice.</p>

<h1 id="h:what-comes-with-the" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">What comes with the game?</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic game will come with an instruction booklet, scoring sheets, the walls, eight sets of 6-sided dice (10 dice per set), and two floors. &nbsp;The floors are double-sided, so there will be four different game plays. &nbsp;&nbsp;The dice will differ in color so that each player can readily distinguish their gladiators from those of opponents. &nbsp;I am consulting with an eye physician for the purpose of accommodating color blindness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the basic game, there will be expansions available. &nbsp;There will be several different floors, a card deck, special dice and moveable obstacles, to name a few. &nbsp;At this time these are in development.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h1 id="h:why-is-there-only-a" class="page-anchor">&nbsp;<span class="bold">Why is there only a prototype? &nbsp;How will it differ from the final game?</span>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game’s graphics cannot be finalized until the campaign has ended. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because the printed game will include pictures of the backers! &nbsp;There are pledge levels that will allow backers to have their photos included in the stadium crowd, as one of the statues on the outside, or one of the main eight named characters that will appear on the box art, the instructions and the characters stickers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outside of the stadium are arches, some of which contain statues on the prototype. &nbsp;In the final game, there will be statues in all of the arches. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the graphics on the floors will move beyond simple shapes to theme-based images.</p>
<h1 id="h:can-we-see-the-rules" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">Can we see the rules?</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course! &nbsp;The final instruction booklet will have additional graphics and examples, as well as credits of backers and special thank-yous. &nbsp;There will also be a special section that shows the artist's rendering of each of the backers who pledged at the level to become a named Gladiator.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Objective</span> - Have the highest score and thus be deemed the Champion of the Gladiator Games. Scores are based on the value on top of each Gladiator (die) plus the effect of any modifiers of which the Gladiator crosses the line.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Game Time</span> – Games take 30-60 seconds per player per round. &nbsp;There have been rapid-fire games that are much shorter, and pure strategists who take forever to decide on a move, but this is a generally typical game length.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Contents</span> - One set of walls, two double-sided floors, eight sets of ten dice each, score sheets, instruction booklet, original art.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Setup</span> – Stand up the walls with the bottom tabs pointing to the center. &nbsp;Insert the floor of your choice. &nbsp;Each player gets a team of 10 Gladiators (dice). Stadium Dice may be played with 2-8 people, individually or as teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bold">How To Play</span></p>
<p>1) Choose which player will be the Start Player for the first event. Rounds will be played until all players have had a &nbsp;turn being the Start Player and the Last Player (the last player has an advantage). For example, if there are six &nbsp;players, there will be six rounds. The score sheet indicates the first player for each round with a bold box.</p>
<p>2) During each round, players take turns throwing a single Gladiator into the stadium. Players may drop, roll or throw &nbsp;their Gladiators, with each player deploying one Gladiator per turn. Therefore, each player gets to go 10 times &nbsp;per round, regardless of how many players there are.</p>
<p>3) Players may carefully drop or strongly throw their Gladiators as needed to manipulate the other &nbsp;Gladiators on the &nbsp;stadium floor. They may try to reduce a competitor’s score or increase their own (think shuffleboard or bocce &nbsp;type of strategy).</p>
<p>4) After all Gladiators have entered the stadium and the dust has settled, players total up the values of their teams. &nbsp;&nbsp;The modifiers on the floor of the stadium affect the value of each Gladiator. For example, a Gladiator worth 2, &nbsp;which lands on a modifier of -4, is worth -2. Record as scores the total of each team’s Gladiators.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;After all players have had a turn at being the First/Last Player, the scores from all the rounds are added and the &nbsp;highest score is the Champion of the Gladiator Games.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rules:</span></p>
<p>1) Unless modified, Gladiators are scored at face value.</p>
<p>2) Gladiators that break the line of a modifier receive that modifier’s bonus or penalty.</p>
<p>3) Modifiers vary with the stadium floor – refer to the specific stadium floor’s modifiers for final scoring.</p>
<p>4) No one may have any part of their hand go below the top of the stadium walls when deploying Gladiators. If caught &nbsp;doing so, the player is penalized at the end of the round by having a Gladiator removed from scoring for each &nbsp;infraction. Opponents get to decide which Gladiators do not get scored.</p>
<p>5) Gladiator Stack: If one Gladiator is on top of another at the end of a round, the bottom Gladiator is dead (worth 0 &nbsp;points) and the victor is worth 6 plus the value of the defeated Gladiator, then times that by 2. Modifiers do &nbsp;not apply.</p>
<p>6) If you throw a Gladiator and miss the stadium: &nbsp;a) if you miss entirely and air-ball it, you may re-throw, b) if you hit the stadium at all, you may not re-throw.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Stretch Goal #1 - $6,000 - Backer's Choice</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All games will come with your choice of reward, either the score-altering deck (now dubbed the Secret Weapon Deck) or the drinking rules (now dubbed Drunkard's Dilemma Rules).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stretch Goal #2 - $7,500 - Both Rewards</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All games will come with BOTH of the above rewards!</p>
<p>The Secret Weapon Deck will be comprised of 16 cards, some having secret weapons that will affect scoring at the end of the round, and some blank. &nbsp;Before each round, the deck is shuffled and each player draws one card. &nbsp;After looking at the card, it is placed face down in front of the player. &nbsp;At the end of the round, all cards are revealed, and scores are adjusted as indicated on the drawn cards.</p>
<p>The Drunkard's Dilemma Rules were born from the many play testers who, after taking a few turns at the game, exuberantly and spontaneously shouted "This would make a GREAT drinking game! &nbsp;Please make drinking game rules!" &nbsp;I'm not going to post them here, as they haven't been thoroughly tested, er, I mean finalized, yet. &nbsp;(hiccup) &nbsp;But we encourage everyone to drink and battle responsibly.</p>
<p>Spread the good word and let's get these stretch goals!</p>

<h1 id="h:so-who-is-the-creato" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">So, who is the creator, and why? &nbsp;Give us the dirt!</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been making board games as a hobby for a few years. &nbsp;Strictly for friend and family time. &nbsp;But many people were encouraging me to try and get the games made so that other people could enjoy them. &nbsp;So in 2018, at the suggestion of some great people in a board game Meetup group I belong to (shout out to BoardgamesNJ), I signed up for Metatopia in Morristown, NJ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Metatopia I had three games I was playtesting. &nbsp;One was about 2 years old, one about a year old, and one only a couple of months old. &nbsp;Two days before the convention started, I woke up with an idea for another game - Stadium Dice. &nbsp;The next day after work I threw together a prototype, and took it with everything else to the convention. &nbsp;The event organizers were very gracious and said I could put it on a small table next to my other games being playtested. &nbsp;But it was not registered, so there was no sign-up sheet for playtesters, and it wasn't listed in the documentation or on the website. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, it went viral. &nbsp;One time I left it out in the hall when I used the ladies' room (the original prototype was not collapsible and it was too big to bring in). &nbsp;I came out a couple of minutes later and a group of people were playing it, and dare I say, loving it. &nbsp;The other games I had brought needed additional work in some way, but Stadium Dice seemed ready to go! &nbsp;Funny how things work out sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I had several game ideas that seemed viable, I decided to create a game company, <a href="http://www.elwoodsgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="bold">Elwood's Games</span></a><span class="bold">.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;This name has special personal meaning to me, and if you are the sentimental type and want to know more, you can read about it on the website.</p>
<h1 id="h:so-whats-next" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">So what's next?</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second-generation prototype reflects some minor changes, without really impacting the overall gameplay that people enjoy. &nbsp;One issue I noticed was that the height of the walls prohibited players from seeing the floor of the arena. &nbsp;But the walls are used in the game, so I couldn't really minimize them too much. &nbsp;Lowering them 2" (from 10" high to 8") seemed to be a good compromise. &nbsp;Enlarging the floor area also helped with viewing during play.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also made the width of the wall sections narrower and increased their number to 16, which allowed for a great modification. &nbsp;By creating joints between all the panels, players can insert different shape floors into the arena and the entire arena will change shape. &nbsp;By selecting different floors, not only do players get the option of different scoring platforms, but they can change the arena shape to a square, rectangle, octagon, circle or oval. &nbsp;And the floors are reversible, so each floor provides two different scoring experiences.</p>

To date there has been QUITE the learning curve.  But I have met every goal and deadline I have set, and then some.  I know it will take a LOT of hard work and dedication.  I believe my biggest challenges will be the artwork and shipping.  The artwork cannot be done until after the campaign ends because it will include photos of backers.  Totally worth the wait!  Because of the "unique" nature of the game's physical structure, I may run into production delays.  I will keep all of my backers updated on the process of getting this game completed and on its way to you, the backer that I truly appreciate.

However, I am dead-set determined to get a quality, complete and fun game into the hands of my backers!  I will not cut corners to save time.  I appreciate the fine artwork and production quality of a good game, and I believe it adds to the enjoyment of your gaming experience.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/elwoodsgames/stadium-dice-working-title/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
