<p>Offshore Gaming is an up-and-coming subscription based game rental program. Fully digital, we are planning to offer plenty of games for you to enjoy, for just a small fee every month. Dont want access to all of our games? Thats fine, we've got your back. With the ability to digitally rent out any individual title that we offer, you can pay a small fee to play for a few days, or even weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>What kind of games will we offer? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We plan to offer small titles such as Kingdom: New lands to games like Call of Duty. We want to offer the best we can, with the resources we have. If theres any team you want doing this, its us. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>What will the updates include? &nbsp;</p>
<p>The behind the scenes/updates are aimed to show you what your money is going towards. With them releasing frequently, and detailed (once development picks up), we can assure you youll be pleased to know exactly what is happening at Offshore, and we are pleased to tell you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Why choose us? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Why not?! As a team, we have been extreme gamers our whole lives. With moderate experience in game development, and major experience in software development, we are aimed to make this happen in a way that pleases you, the consumer. Our whole goal is to make gaming like a library, not a bookstore.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">It will be difficult to get developers to join us. Thats why we made this kickstarter, with the hope to raise the funds to increase the catalog we aim to have. That is one of the ONLY risks when doing this.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/acortina/subscription-based-game-rental-service/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
