<p>The <span class="bold">Savage Company Campaign Setting</span> is a compendium of military and monster-themed action designed to be compatible with the rules and campaign settings found in the <span class="bold">First Edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</span> and now also <span class="bold">Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition</span>. We’ve played for years, writing our own rules to expand on this type of content because the material we were looking for just didn’t exist. Now we have taken all these things, greatly expanded upon them, and built the concept into a fully-fledged campaign setting that can be played on its own or placed into any existing campaign setting.</p>
<p>Designed to expand options, but not necessarily power-creep; these crazy orcs with their guns and loud rumbling alchemical engined vehicles can be played alongside your traditional swords and sorcery content without much adjustment. The goal has been to add a lot of new content, that <span class="text-italic">works with all of the existing content</span> that is out there.</p>
<p>Evenly mixed with vibrant artwork and thrilling stories throughout the book, this will be a joy to read even when you’re not playing the game.</p>

<p>Starting with the city of Tombstone, we have a large region that serves as both a setting for adventures and a home base to send parties to places anywhere in the world. Tombstone is full of locations and NPCs and as a rough and tumble frontier town, it can be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>We have added new races, variants of existing races, and more racial options and feats. Currently, we have about ten races fully written, with a few ideas for more.</p>
<p>There are over 20 classes and archetypes encompassing every type of character, with a heavy focus on archetypes that enable firearm use in new and exciting ways for classes that normally do not get to use guns. To go with these classes are new feats, skills, spells, and additional class options like talents, deeds, and discoveries.</p>
<p>Speaking of guns, we have about 50 weapons fully ready and play-tested, and much more ready to roll out. The focus has been to add weapons that don’t exist in the current game, are balanced to existing weapons, and have a historical flavor somewhere between the wild west, and the Vietnam war.</p>
<p>Along with those guns; are new types of armor, gear and equipment, and a large range of alchemical creations as well. Some of these are non-magical items that have the same effect as magic items currently in the game, and others greatly expand on the military theme. Have no fear, we didn’t forget about the magic. There are many new magic items and magical weapons as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have packed the book with iconic characters that showcase the new classes, gear, and short stories that expand upon the world; as well as accurately demonstrate their abilities and equipment in the course of narrative fiction. These characters also have fully built stat blocks at multiple levels, and can be used as pre-generated, or as a base to build your own for many adventures.</p>
<p>Along with our characters we have supplied new vehicles and a modular vehicle customization system that will allow you to quickly design hundreds of robust and wildly different types of vehicles. With these rules also comes the Rolling Road Combat ruleset. Rolling Road brings easy and fast-paced, fluid vehicle combat rules that make fighting on the move fun and deadly. To top it all off, you’ll also get Thrashcans and Thumpsters, unique vehicles that serve as mounts and have no facing rules allowing you to stomp across the battlefield in a mobile armored weapon platform.</p>

<p>Currently, we have <span class="bold">90% of our book completed</span>, comprising of <span class="bold">over 400 pages</span> of finished material. Writing the rest will be easy, but we need help funding the remaining art, and having the professionals at Fat Goblin Games format everything into a nice PDF.</p>
<p>We are guys with full-time jobs, and families; however, this hasn't hindered our efforts to fund the core project out of our own pockets. It is our intention to continue to do so. Your pledge will go towards the additional 40 pieces of art we still need inside the book and the layout artists who take our rough documents and turn them into gorgeous PDFs for you.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Goals</span></p>
<p>Our base goal of <span class="bold">$3,400</span> is what we need to get the minimum amount of art to complete the book. We will still be providing our own funds while the campaign is ongoing, but this is just enough to push us over the hump and get the book completed. We’re working hard on the book now, and will continue to do so during the campaign in order to deliver the books quickly. We are running dual campaigns and they will be totaled together for determining stretch goals.</p>
<p>We have also partnered with Q-Workshop, the makers of the official Pathfinder dice to produce exclusive Savage Company dice sets for backers. We will be working closely with those on the War Council, General, and Founder levels to design new content and host playtest game sessions. Print copies will be made available through DrivethruRPG.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Stretch</span> <span class="bold">goal of $7500</span></p>
<p>At this level, we will be able to bring in some extraordinary artists and add additional art to the book that we would love to, but isn't really possible on our current, mostly self-funded budget.</p>
<p>We will be able to create panoramic full scenes packed with action, and characters; really putting you inside the world. There are several well-known artists who we are talking to, but we don’t want to name them until we get them under contract. One we can name however is Marc Lee, who did our cover art and currently does a lot of work for the Warhammer 40k Black Library series. We will update you all as the campaign progresses and are able to release more information.</p>

Less funding will mean it takes longer, but the book will be completed even without meeting any crowdfunding goals. 
Another concern is the lead time from Q-Workshop, they often take anywhere from 60 to 120 days to manufacture the product and a lot of the timeframe is dependent on their current workload and backlog. If there are delays in manufacturing that will only postpone the shipping of those items, and will not impact the rest of the project. 
We have been very wary about the potential to over-promise, which is why we waited until nearly all of the book was written before choosing to launch any funding campaigns.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/shmpublishing/savage-company-campaign-setting-for-the-pathfinder-rpg/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
