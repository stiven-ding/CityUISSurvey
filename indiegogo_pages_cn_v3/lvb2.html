It’s time to ditch these. <b>It’s time to use energy-saving and environmentally friendly wind energy to power your electronics! </b>

                    <b>WHY SHIINE?</b> <br>
                    Off-grid energy solutions play a crucial role in providing reliable electricity source in a timely and sustainable manner. Access to electricity off-grid is essential in your long journeys as electronics often require more charging power but are hardly realized by existing products. Without a reliable energy source, you can find yourself in vulnerable situations when your battery supply can’t be replenished.
                    <img class="photo" src="./low verbal-2/img7.jpg">The patent-pending technology instantly converts wind into electricity and is applicable to a variety of electronics. Besides, its 12,000 mAh Li-Ion battery provides the function for storing energy for later use.<br><br>
                    <b>Our distinctive advantages</b> <br>
(1) Resists sand, dirt, and dust build-up.<br>
(2) The wind supply is abundant and inexhaustible in most of countries, such as U.S. and Canada. Doesn’t require a phone, Bluetooth, or any other device to obtain electricity. <br>
(3) Reduce your ecological impact. It won't produce atmospheric emissions that cause acid rain, smog, or greenhouse gases.<br>
(4) Durability: made of aircraft-grade aluminum, and injection-molded polycarbonate-reinforced plastic to withstand the wear and tear of the outdoors; built-in heat dissipation for running at high wind speeds.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low verbal-2/img8.jpg">Plug a USB cable into Shine to power gear in real-time while the turbine is running or stowed. Use the charger while at basecamp, or pack it up and continue to power electronics while the turbine is stowed in your pack. 
                    <br><br>
                    The energy is produced faster than any other similar products in the market. This 40-watt charger is applicable to phones, tablets, lights, drones, cameras, GPS, speakers, e-readers, headphones, power banks, and more.  
                    <img class="photo" src="./low verbal-2/img21.jpg">
                    Whether you’re camping, canoeing, RVing, hanging at a cottage, or looking to prepare for an emergency, the Shine Turbine provides renewable power day and night, rain, cloud, or shine.
                    <img class="photo" src="./low verbal-2/img26.jpg"><b>Who is Shine for<br></b>
                    It is designed for anyone who wants to charge handheld electronics while disconnected from the energy grid. The turbine is perfect for these situations: backpacking, camping, RVing, fishing, hunting, remote working, and more. You will have a non-stop source of power and a light to see in the dark. Do not hesitate and head out on a journey!

                    <b>Advantages of wind energy</b><br>Wind is used to produce electricity using the kinetic energy created by air in motion. Wind first hits a turbine’s blades, causing them to rotate and turn the turbine connected to them. That changes the kinetic energy to rotational energy, by moving a shaft which is connected to a generator, and thereby producing electrical energy through electromagnetism.  
                    <br><br>
                    "An amazing thing about wind energy is that when the wind speed doubles, you can get eight times more power from a wind turbine. This is the cubic relationship of power to wind speed, which is why it can charge things so fast on a windy day."<br>
                    - Wayne Groszko, Ph.D., Applied Energy Research Scientist
                                        <br><br>The cubic output of wind, paired with high-efficiency blades and lightweight design, allow the turbine to produce a large quantity of electricity.<br>

                    <b>The team </b><br>
                    We have been developing the product since 2018 and have overcome countless technical hurdles. These ranged from optimizing the pivot point to face it into the wind, to fitting everything needed to set up the turbine inside its internal compartment, to its patent-pending design that provides portability without sacrificing efficiency!    
                    <br><br>
                    Aurea Technologies, the company behind Shine, is based in the coastal province of Nova Scotia, Canada, where there’s never a shortage of wind!
                    <br><br>
                    We're a team of outdoor lovers with a passion for clean energy and the environment. With years of expertise in wind turbine engineering, supply chain management, production, and customer service, we're beyond ready to bring you the future of portable wind charging!
                    <br><br>
                    We’re nearly at the finish line! Shine is currently undergoing product certification and once this is complete, we can start deliveries. We’ve started production beginning with the product’s mechanical sub-assemblies. This will give us the ability to promptly fulfill orders as soon as Shine passes certification.
