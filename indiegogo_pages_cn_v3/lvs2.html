It’s time to ditch these. <b>It’s time to use clean, efficient wind energy to power your devices!</b>
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-2-v3/img0.jpg" >
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-2-v3/img1.jpg" > The Shine Turbine is the ultra-compact, highly efficient, portable wind charger that lets you use the wind to rapidly create your own power to charge all your handheld devices - from your phone to your camera - anytime, anywhere there is wind.
                    
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-2-v3/img2.jpg" >
                    From exploring coasts to navigating plains to scaling mountains, all you need to do is set up Shine and in under 2 minutes, you’ll have a wind generator to power your adventures. Charge phones, tablets, lights, cameras, and more with this small but mighty 40 W turbine. Power gear in real-time during the day or night, or rapidly store energy for later use with Shine’s internal 12,000 mAh Li-Ion battery.

                   <b>WHY SHIINE?</b> <br>
                    Access to renewable power off-grid is essential as electronics often require more charging power than portable batteries can provide. Without a reliable energy source, you can find yourself in vulnerable situations when your battery supply can’t be replenished.
                    <br><br>
                    Whether you’re camping, canoeing, RVing, hanging at a cottage, or looking to prepare for an emergency, the Shine Turbine provides renewable power day and night, rain, cloud, or shine.
                    
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-2-v3/img4.jpg" >Shine’s patent-pending technology instantly converts wind into power to charge a variety of devices or rapidly stores energy in its internal battery for later use.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-2-v3/img5.jpg" ><b>Shine has distinctive advantages<br></b>
                    (1) The turbine weighs 3 lbs and collapses into the size of a water bottle so you can have access to wind power wherever you go.
                    <br>(2) Set up takes 2 minutes or less with everything you need stored inside the turbine.
                    <br>(3) Access energy whenever you need it or precharge Shine via a wall outlet.
                    <br>(4) Power your devices even when it's raining and withstand sand, dirt, and dust build-up.
                    <br>(5) Doesn’t require a phone, Bluetooth, or any other device to generate power.
                    <br>(6) Produce clean wind energy and reduce your ecological impact.
                    <br>(7) Durability: made of aircraft-grade aluminum, and injection-molded polycarbonate-reinforced plastic to withstand the wear and tear of the outdoors; built-in heat dissipation for operation at high wind speeds.
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-2-v3/img6.jpg" >Plug a USB cable into Shine to power devices while the turbine is in operation or stowed. Plug your phone into Shine while at basecamp, or pack Shine up and continue to power devices while the turbine is stowed in your pack. This 40-watt ultra-compact wind charger can power any handheld USB device, including phones, tablets, lights, drones, cameras, GPS, speakers, e-readers, headphones, power banks, and more.  
                    <br><br>
                    Shine creates energy faster than any other handheld renewable product. It is able to collect three phones' worth of power in an hour at maximum rated wind speeds.

                    <b>Who is Shine for</b><br>
                    Shine is for anyone who wants to charge handheld devices while disconnected from the energy grid. The turbine is perfect for keeping electronics charged while backpacking, camping, RVing, fishing, hunting, remote working, and more. You will have a non-stop source of power to keep your phone running and a light to see in the dark. Head out on an adventure!

                    We have been developing the product since 2018 and have overcome countless technical hurdles. These ranged from optimizing the pivot point to face Shine into the wind, to fitting everything needed to set up the turbine inside its internal compartment, to its patent-pending turbine design that provides portability without sacrificing efficiency!  
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-2-v3/img9.jpg" >
                    Aurea Technologies, the company behind Shine, is based in the coastal province of Nova Scotia, Canada, where there’s never a shortage of wind!
