                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img2.jpg" >It’s a new era in fashion innovation -- the first highly functional, durable vegan leather. A vintage look and feel, from materials created to last well into the future. Function meets fashion in the timeless MOONRAKERS Vegan Leather Coat.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img3.jpg" >It’s Japanese innovation & craftsmanship, the precision-designed fabric that is made to last. Reimagine leather with NANODESIGN™ technology, combining both comfort of natural materials and the functionality of synthetics.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img5.jpg" >
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img6.jpg" >MOONRAKER's 0.3mm ultra-thin fabric made from 0.19 decitex ultrafine fibers from "NANODESIGN™" provides the strength and feel of leather at half the weight.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img8.jpg" >
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img9.jpg" >The new era vegan leather with innovative design and texture brings whole new feel and style your way. Artisanal “garment dyeing” gives your MOONRAKERS a unique color and vintage, naturally worn look that’s yours and yours alone. With distinctive, unique colors hand-dyed by Japanese craftsmen. This hand-dyed garment’s tasteful vintage-like color elevates any outfit from sweaters to T-shirts.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img11.jpg" >The high-density weave of the fabric keeps the wind out and warmth in. It allows for an air permeability of 0.33cc or lees, perfect for transitioning through the seasons. Hardcore outdoor weather and damp conditions are no match for this very unconventional coat.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img13.jpg" >
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img22.jpg" >As we innovate with fabrics, we weave in traditional craftsmanship by hand-dying each coat, so no two colors are exactly alike. But every coat we craft is light, weather-proof, and versatile throughout the year.
                    <br> <br>
                    Our ultra-thin NANODESIGN™ fabrics provide all the comfort and qualities of traditional leather while offering increased functionality for outdoor use. We continually research and innovate the creation of fabrics that provide the comfort and familiarity of natural materials and allow us to go beyond conventional functions and textures.
                    <br> <br>
                    Like leather, but better. Toray's NANODESIGN™ Technology gives you all the feel without all the weight. Ultra-thin, durable, and completely ethical, the MOONRAKERS vegan leather coat just feels right.
                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img27.jpg" >Every coat has ultra-lightweight to wear and carry, around 1.1lbs / 500g. Folded up and packed away, your MOONRAKERS is only 1.2 inches (3cm) thick -- almost the same size as a novel. It’s the perfect size to keep in your bag whether you’re heading across town or across the country. Your MOONRAKERS Vegan Leather Coat arrives complete with a 18cm*25cm storage bag. Zip the bag shut and easily pack it alongside whatever you’re traveling with.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img32.jpg" >We’ve successfully launched it in Japan through Makuake earlier in January 2021 with 500+ backers supporting us. All the fulfillment is completed in June 2021 with lots of happy backers.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low visual-1/img33.jpg" >We are a sustainable apparel brand that respects nature in two ways. By crafting a coat that is worthy of being worn almost year-round in harsh weather, and by using innovative materials that last into the future to eliminate waste.
                    <br> <br>
                    We are proudly backed by Toray Group from Japan, one of the world’s largest textile companies. Beginning with MOONRAKERS, we hope to transform the apparel industry. Welcome to the first act of our sustainable fashion movement.
