                    Introducing the first highly functional, durable vegan leather: the timeless MOONRAKERS Vegan Leather Coat.                    <br><br>
                    Vegan leather has gone a long way over the past few decades. Some products are often mistaken for the real thing, despite the essential ingredients are completely different from the real leather goods.                    <br><br>
                    Every year, more than a billion sheep, alligators, cows, pigs, goats, ostriches, kangaroos, and even dogs and cats are cruelly slaughtered for their skins. The tails and horns are cut off without painkillers, and some are even skinned and cut apart while still conscious. By contrast, faux leather is eco-friendly and does not cause any killing without using animal skins.                    <br><br>
                    <img class="photo" src="./low verbal-1/img9.jpg" >
                    Aside from environmental concerns, faux leather is often much cheaper because synthetic plastic leather is less expensive to create than real leather. Faux leather is frequently considerably thinner and lighter than real leather, which is wonderful for fashion because it makes it potentially easier to work with.
                    <br><br>
However, the durability is always a problem faced by producers. Many products are more likely to break or scuff badly over time. As a result, the environmental impact of replacing a faux leather product repeatedly is potentially more destructive than purchasing a single real leather item.    <br><br>

But our clothing overcomes these shortcomings and is different from the prior faux leather clothing. Reimagine leather with our advanced techniques. The precision-designed fabric that is made to last. 

                    <img class="photo" src="./low verbal-1/img12.gif" >Toray has developed a proprietary polymer extrusion technology. The flow of polymer can be divided and controlled multiple times to make fibers finer. The precise nano-level control of the polymer flow enables us to create never seen before textiles. The fabric made from 0.19 decitex ultrafine fibers provides the strength and feel of leather at half the weight.

                    Artisanal “garment dyeing” gives your clothing a distinctive color and naturally worn look that’s yours and yours alone. No two colors are exactly alike. This garment’s distinctive taste elevates any outfit from sweaters to T-shirts.
                    <br><br>

                    The high-density weave of the textiles allows for an air permeability of 0.33cc or lees, perfect for transitioning through the seasons. Hardcore outdoor weather and damp conditions are no match for this very unconventional clothing.

                    <img class="photo" src="./low verbal-1/img26.jpg" >Folded up and packed away, it’s the perfect size to keep in your bag whether you’re heading across town or across the country. It arrives complete with a 18cm*25cm storage bag. Zip the bag shut and easily pack it alongside whatever you’re traveling with.
                    <img class="photo" src="./low verbal-1/img28.gif" >We’ve successfully launched it in Japan through Makuake earlier in January 2021 with 500+ backers supporting us. All the fulfillment is completed in June 2021 with lots of happy backers.
                    <img class="photo" src="./low verbal-1/img32.jpg" >We are a sustainable apparel brand that respects nature in two ways. By crafting a coat that is worthy of being worn almost year-round in harsh weather, and by using renewable and sustainable materials to eliminate waste. 

                    <br><br>
                    We are proudly backed by Toray Group from Japan, one of the world’s largest textile companies. We hope to transform the apparel industry. Welcome to the first act of our sustainable fashion movement.
