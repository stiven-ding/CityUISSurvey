                    <b>HOW DO YOU POWER YOUR OUTDOOR ADVENTURES? </b>Love hiking and camping, but worry about not having
                    power if there's an emergency? Wind power is one of the largest producers of clean energy in the world, yet most people don't have direct access to it. It's time to take wind power into your own hands and now you can with Shine.

                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-2/img5.jpg">
                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-2/img6.gif">
                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-2/img7.jpg">The Shine Turbine is the ultra-compact, highly efficient, portable wind charger that lets you use the wind to rapidly create and stores clean energy to power handheld devices like your camera and drone day or night wherever the wind blows.
                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-2/img8.jpg">From exploring coasts to navigating plains to scaling mountains, all you need to do is set up Shine and in under 2 minutes, you’ll have a wind generator to power your adventures. You can charge it whenever you want and its battery can fully power things like your iPad or phone. 12.000mAh battery can charge up to 4 devices and 3 phones worth of power can be collected in as little as an hour.

                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-2/img19.jpg">Access to renewable power off-grid is essential as electronics often require more charging power than portable batteries can provide. Solar panels don't always work when you need them to. Generators are loud and expensive and battery packs always die. Portable power stations are too heavy and it's easy to forget to charge battery packs.
                    <br><br>
                    With Shine you have the freedom to charge and explore on your own terms, day and night, rain, cloud, or shine. Don't know where the wind's coming from? No problem! Shine automatically turns into the wind as long as the leaves are rustling, you’re in business. An umbrella may not be able to handle high winds But Shine can.
                    
                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-2/img21.jpg">As nature lovers and outdoor adventurers, we spent the last three years developing a product, delivers all the benefits of a large wind turbine, scaled down to fit in your backpack.
                    <br> <br>
                    It's super lightweight with the highest power-to-weight ratio compared to solar panels water turbines and thermoelectric stoves. This means you're getting the most power for the least amount of weight you have to carry. Also, it's incredibly quiet with maximum of 50 dB!
                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-2/img26.jpg">Shine has distinctive advantages<br>

                    <img class="photo" src="./high verbal-2/img63.jpg">The Shine Turbine team has been developing the product since 2018 and has overcome countless technical hurdles. These ranged from optimizing the pivot point to face Shine into the wind, to fitting everything needed to set up the turbine inside its internal compartment, to its patent-pending turbine design that provides portability without sacrificing efficiency!  
                    <br> <br>
                    Aurea Technologies, the company behind Shine, is based in the coastal province of Nova Scotia, Canada, where there’s never a shortage of wind!
                    <br> <br>
                    With years of expertise in wind turbine engineering, supply chain management, production, and customer service, we're beyond ready to bring you the future of portable wind charging!                    <br> <br>
                    We’re nearly at the finish line! Shine is currently undergoing product certification and once this is complete, we can start deliveries. We’ve started production beginning with the product’s mechanical sub-assemblies. This will give us the ability to promptly fulfill orders as soon as Shine passes certification.
