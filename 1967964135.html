<p>To make matters harder, you live in a world that feels increasingly messy — from global issues, to business challenges, to personal growth &amp; development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:so-whats-worth-doing" class="page-anchor">So what's *worth* doing?</h1>
<p>How do we face the question that looms over all of these challenges? How do we decide <span class="text-italic">what's worth doing</span>?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="text-italic">What's Worth Doing</span> uses a simple hexagon shape to help you create a mind map around three main questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What <span class="bold">challenges</span> do you want to address?</li>
  <li>What kind of <span class="bold">people</span> do you enjoy working with?</li>
  <li>What do you like to <span class="bold">make</span>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll be challenged to sort through 75 cards quickly and then draw connections across your mind map to see what types of interesting and meaningful projects you might do next. The cards help you navigate transitions and dive deeper into your work by designing small projects that allow you to learn, grow, and change your world for the better.</p>

<h1 id="h:how-did-this-come-to" class="page-anchor">HOW DID THIS COME TO BE?</h1>
<p>Oh hey there. My name is Victor and I'm the founder of Experience Institute, a Lecturer at Stanford, and co-owner of Brand Deck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2012, I was at my own crossroads. I needed more education, or so I thought. But the options were too expensive and more school just wasn't a fit for me. So I decided to design my own masters through 12 projects in 12 months, all over the world. I called it the Leap Year Project.</p>
<p>That year changed my life. So I started an organization focused on helping students and career professionals from all backgrounds navigate their own life <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">transitions</span></span> .</p>
<p><span class="bold">Transitions</span> between school and the workplace. Between one job and the next (the average American today will have <a href="https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsfaqs.htm#anch41" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no fewer than 12 jobs over the course of their life</a>). Between one career and the next. Between one important project to the next important project. During these conversations, we’d ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What kinds of <span class="bold">challenges</span> do you want to work on? What issues in the world excite or frustrate you?</li>
  <li>How do you like to work? What activities do you enjoy? What do you like to <span class="bold">make?</span>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>What kinds of <span class="bold">people</span> do you want to be around and work alongside?</li>
</ul>
<p>We all need a starting point, something that help us begin to see through the fog of endless possibilities and expectations. This is especially true in times of transition. So after having many of these conversations, we started developing this simple visual:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="26447410">

<p>We found that this simple visual is incredibly helpful in framing the most important considerations. It led people to identify unique opportunities that exist in the overlap of all three circles—AKA, their <span class="text-italic">starting point</span>.</p>

<h1 id="h:inspiration-for-desi" class="page-anchor">&nbsp;<span class="bold">Inspiration</span> for <span class="bold">Design &amp; Gameplay</span>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>When working on how to create the initial design and gameplay, we leaned heavily on a product designed by Scott Thomas called Brand Deck. The simple nature of the sorting exercise for a grand life question was compelling. Our original designs were very similar: poker cards and minimal designs.</p>
<p>But we wondered how to incorporate the venn diagram above. Could the cards connect? Or overlap? Should there be a game board?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We kept hitting snags. So we paused design, went on a trip, and then came back with the idea to change the SHAPE of the cards. And the hexagon gameplay was born. Though the cards don't overlap, the ability to "connect" your responses helps to embed the idea that your interests, abilities, and community can be mixed into any number of possible projects and next steps. Seeing them together is where the new discoveries emerge.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="h:logistics-team-and-t" class="page-anchor">Logistics, Team, and Timeline</h1>
<p>The team behind What's Worth Doing has spent the past seven years designing books, tool kits, and cards that have been shipped around the world. We already have the majority of the designs for What's Worth Doing, a fantastic printer, and a fulfillment operation that can handle any number of orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The timeline will look like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<span class="bold">October 17th</span> | Close Campaign</li>
  <li>&nbsp;<span class="bold">End of October</span> | Send final files to printer</li>
  <li>&nbsp;<span class="bold">Mid-November</span> | Receive proofs</li>
  <li>&nbsp;<span class="bold">Early-January</span> | Receive Cards</li>
  <li>&nbsp;<span class="bold">February</span> | Ship cards to YOU!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1 id="h:why-kickstarter" class="page-anchor">Why Kickstarter?&nbsp;</h1>
<p>We love Kickstarter. This community has helped us produce projects that are now in the hands of thousands of students, educators, and career professionals. We think this is the fastest and best way for us to get these cards into your hands and make improvements as a community. With you, we think we can make it even better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with all of the hexagonal goodness this page can muster, please back this Kickstarter and let's make this happen!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

But we've searched high and low for a printer that can produce high quality cards, at a cost-effective rate in a timely manner. We're focused on getting these cards to you on time (January 2020) so you can begin using it as soon as possible, so we made sure to keep the rewards extra simple —&nbsp;no extra swag or gear. Just a deck of cards that will make life's daunting decisions a little less heavy.
