<p>While working on a very large jigsaw puzzle of an image of a box of opened chocolates my father&nbsp;said 'I wish I could just eat one of these chocolates". We looked at each other and both said wouldn't it be fun if you actually got what was in the puzzle image as the gift and not just a picture of it. One thing led to another and we came up with the idea of a process of giving a jigsaw puzzle of an image of something that is in fact the gift the recipient will receive if they solve the puzzle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We fleshed out some of the process details and realized it could be applied to many things and ways of giving interesting and challenging gifts. We decided it was worth the risk to try and explore developing this further, so we started by finding a custom image puzzle maker (we actually used a Groupon coupon to buy about 20 of them). We have since decided to buy some sublimation paper and ink, a printer that can handle this paper and a heat press for the puzzles for this Kickstarter project because it will be cheaper and more flexible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We initially chose two products to use as the 'Solve The Gift" puzzle/product. One from a store my mother runs in Maplewood NJ called Hopscotch (that is the company we are actually using to do this). We chose a Lobster Towel for young children/babies and one from a family friend who makes Adult Themed Lollipops at SuckerBourne (by adult themed - they taste of drinks e.g. Champagne, not adult shaped). <a href="http://www.suckerborne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.suckerbourne.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once we had the product and the puzzles ready we bought some small bags to hold the puzzle pieces and had a print stamp made for "Solve the Gift" and stamped out a number of bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We put a website together to explain the concept and for people to be able to claim the actual gift once they have solved the puzzle (or they can email us to accomplish the same thing). We thought it would be good to enforce the completion of the puzzle so we ask that people send us a selfie image of the completed puzzle. We have a number of ideas around what happens with uncompleted unclaimed gifts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also had a short video made using Fiverr to explain the concept and we posted that to the website <a href="http://www.solvethegift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.SolveTheGift.com</a> and also here at the top.</p>
<p>This is the first time we've ever done anything like this and our main goal is to learn about this process and what's involved, plus make a little money for college if possible. We are hoping this Kickstarter project will at least cover the costs of the puzzles/products and applying for the patent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are told the patent costs may go as high as $8,000 and obviously there is no guarantee the patent will awarded. Even if we do not receive the patent, we still feel this idea of challenging your friends/family with a puzzle to make them work at getting a gift is something that would appeal to a lot of people. There are so many people looking for interesting ways to give meaningful gifts to people and this offers something a little bit different from the normal boring gift. We have spent a lot of time searching for anything similar to this Solve the Gift process and we have been unable to find anything. No matter what happens, just working through this process has been a learning experience and incredibly valuable for my Dad and myself, so even if things don't pan out, it's been worthwhile.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Budget</span></p>
<p>Up front costs: Sublimation paper, sublimation ink, high quality printer for sublimation printing, blank cardboard puzzles, heat press, small bags, bag stamps, advertising/promotions. This comes to about $2,000</p>
<p>Ongoing costs: SolveTheGift unit cost (paper, ink, blank cardboard puzzle), bag...about $6.</p>
<p>Shipping - Shipping is a problem. There are two layers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The puzzle itself. To ship the puzzle is around $4, but hopefully we just sell many by hand directly.</li>
  <li>The product shipping once the puzzle is complete. This is more complicated. Initially we plan to have the products in our possession and ship them out, but ideally we remove ourselves from this process and have the items drop-shipped when we receive notification the puzzle is complete. The shipping is dependent on the size/weight and if we proceed with a bluetooth speaker we are thinking around $8.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gift - We are open to suggestions on what we should offer as the gift for this Kickstarter. Obviously, whatever suggestion is made the numbers/costs have to work for the various rewards.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Schedule</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Extend the Non-Provisional Patent paperwork for 4 months to explore the viability of this idea via this Kickstarter project....done.</li>
  <li>Post this Kickstarter project....if you are seeing this, then it's done.</li>
  <li>If the goal of this Kickstarter project is not met, we will re-evaluate and probably close things down having only lost the cost of the provisional patent, the cost of the non-provisional patent extension and the cost of the puzzles we've already had made. This probably totals about $1,000.</li>
  <li>If the goal of this project is met, we will get to work and purchase the printers/ink/paper/cardboard puzzles and start working on the puzzles for the product chosen.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Depending on the product selected we may explore a wholesale purchases. It would be nice to be able to drop-ship these to customers, but we are aware this may not be an option (I know from working in my mum's retail store we may not be able to do this...we'll see).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We've put a delivery date of November on this kickstarter project. We plan to deliver things as soon as possible and we are hoping to easily meet that date or sooner. If things do not work out with us doing the printing (remember, we had the original 40 puzzles for friends and family printed with a custom puzzle maker) we may need the extra time to work with a custom printer. hopefully, this won't be necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Future Plans</span></p>
<p>We have lots of ideas about how we could expand this into a number of delivery processes and also how it would be fun to expand into higher end gifts for people who like solving puzzles. We just can't do this right now. The cost of the puzzle is relatively small and fixed, so the higher we go, the smaller the relative cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some general ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A car. We thought of offering a fancy car (the name of which rhymes with Cessna) as part of this Kickstarter project, but then we wondered about using their name and whether that was permitted, so we backed out of that idea...but you get the picture.</li>
  <li>Marriage proposal. Image of the ring, "Will you marry me", etc.</li>
  <li>Promposal.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Travel/Event package with a picture of the destination, activity, etc.</li>
  <li>Ultra-Customized where you get to pick everything; the gift, the puzzle image, a custom message on the puzzle image, etc.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Drop-shipping - Once you've sold a puzzle, you know within a certain time-period that you are going to have to send that order with an actual product once the customer solves the puzzle, but you have at least a few days. We may be able to create an efficient process to pre-order a product or prepare the order in some way.</li>
  <li>Create a package that contains the puzzle but also contains the gift for the giver to keep and give immediately the puzzle is solved. This would remove the shipping issues and also address the immediate gratification, perhaps some sort of package deal.</li>
  <li>Services gift - some relationship with a Day Spa, Restaurant meal, Movie tickets, etc. where the puzzle is an image of the event. This works great because it reduces shipping.</li>
  <li>Shower Gift (Baby shower or Wedding shower) - where the gift is given and then the group/party helps to solve the gift. If nothing else, your gift stands out from the crowd of other gifts.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To startup we've been using jigsaw puzzles as the "puzzle" to solve, but the puzzle could be any challenge that we manage (a word puzzle, a number puzzle, clues to be solved, etc.).</li>
  <li>Varying levels of puzzle complexity/subject matter tailored to different age groups/interests etc.</li>
  <li>There are lots of point to interact with social media throughout this process; to show that the puzzle has been solved; to thank the giver; to nudge the recipient; to show friends what you are doing.</li>
  <li>Other delivery and solution-proof mechanisms (an App that contains the puzzle to be solved and a way of proving the recipient has solved the puzzle).</li>
  <li>Stagger the gift revelation - the puzzle reveals a clue to the gift they will receive, but does not reveal it completely. They only learn of the actual gift when it arrives in the mail.</li>
  <li>A fixed time period to solve the puzzle, otherwise the dollar value is donated to charity or returned to the gift-giver or lost in some way or maybe, the gift gets less and less the longer it takes them to solve it.</li>
  <li>Any other neat ideas from you?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">People</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>My Dad (Kevin Barron) - I've no idea what he does and he never says, so he's probably an International Government Agent...think something along the lines a male version of Jennifer Garner in Alias.</li>
  <li>My Mum (Bernadette Malizia Barron) - Her store is Hopscotch in Maplewood NJ. She's been running this for the past 30 years and we stole some of the products from her store as the prototype (the lobster towels) when we tried this out for friends and family.</li>
  <li>Myself (Elizabeth Barron) - I attend Columbia High School in Maplewood NJ. I will be graduating next year. I enjoy robotics and have an interest in engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of us have ever done anything like this before – so it’s going to be a bit of an adventure figuring out all the steps.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">The first piece of advice we received was to obtain a patent for the process so we filed a provisional patent last year. We are still working through the non-provisional patent process and I believe the biggest risk and probably the biggest potential value is in the awarding of this patent. Without it, we can still create and deliver some interesting products, but with it we can build this process out to encompass almost anything. Another challenge has been to create a prototype while also keeping our costs down. We obviously realize we can have puzzles made on a larger scale that would bring the unit cost down (especially made overseas), but we have decided that for this project we will stay more flexible and carry a higher unit cost. There is also the negative issue of this process does not deliver immediate gratification. We have thought of a way around this if the giver is prepared to wait and manage the giving of the gift themselves (see future plans above), but it is a challenge. I think these are the biggest risks/challenges.....these and obviously the fact we are very inexperienced. We have 10 of the Lobster Baby Towel puzzles already done and 10 of the Adult themed Lollipops done and we've used these with friends and family....we are in the process of deciding what product would work best with this Kickstarter thing. The leading candidate for this a nice Bluetooth speaker. It's generic and simple and broadly desirable. However, we are open to suggestions/ideas. That's another goal of this project....to gather lots of feedback.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/26591721/solve-the-gift/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
