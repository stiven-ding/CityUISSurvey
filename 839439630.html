<p>&nbsp;What are holocrons anyway? They are data artifacts that store the knowledge of the Jedi or Sith who created them (for better or worse.) Stumbling across one can open doors to a greater understanding of the Force…or allow the darkness to come pouring in. &nbsp;Our story follows Eramin, a supposed Jedi Master who hunts holocrons and races against the Sith Lord Corvus for ownership of these dangerous prizes. But this latest holocron is different - the soul of a rather cunning and manipulative Sith Mistress resides deep within, and Eramin is about to learn what happens when he falls prey to her dark whisperings.</p>
<p>Holocrons have yet to be shown on the silver screen, though they have played a part in the animated series Star Wars Rebels and Attack of the Clones. We think it would be pretty cool to show Star Wars fans what a real-life holocron looks like, and how it might behave if it falls into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>We’re a bunch of Star Wars fans, but we’re also professional filmmakers. And we think you’ll enjoy watching our fan short film as much as we’ll enjoy making it. We're challenging ourselves to see if we can shoot a film that looks nearly identical to a massive budget, studio-funded one.</p>
<p>But more importantly, our Director is a professor of film at the University of Colorado Denver, and this is a learning opportunity for her students! How do Hollywood, big-budget films get made? How did they shoot that lightsaber fight scene in the forest? What is the process of casting actors, scouting locations, and assembling props and costumes? How do you use industry-standard gear, like jibs and steadicams?</p>
<p>These are skills and answers that the film crew (which consists mostly of students) will learn through the process of making this 10-minute short. Key positions will be held by industry professionals who have shot features, corporate, commercials, and documentaries world-wide. This is a chance for students to get hands-on training with experienced filmmakers to learn directly under them, without having to pay for an expensive internship. By the time they graduate, they will have The Holocron as a portfolio piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Making films is expensive. &nbsp;And making good-looking films costs even more. &nbsp;To alleviate the cost of production, we're here on Kickstarter with a budget goal of $12,000. &nbsp;That money will be spent responsibly, because the higher level crew members are industry professionals who do this as a daily job. &nbsp;There's always risk when it comes to making films, but we're positive that we will complete the film from start to finish, on time, and on budget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So where goes all that money go? &nbsp;We listed our approximate budget line items so far:</p>
<ul>
  <li>stunt choreography / lightsaber training ($200)</li>
  <li>camera &amp; lens package rental ($3,000)</li>
  <li>casting for professional talent ($1,000)</li>
  <li>props (lightsabers, weapons, holocron, etc) ($1,500)</li>
  <li>location fees ($1,500)</li>
  <li>feeding &amp; transporting the crew ($1,000)</li>
  <li>renting specialty gear (jib/crane, wind machines, dolly, steadicam) ($2,000)</li>
  <li>costumes, hair, &amp; makeup ($1,000)</li>
  <li>music composer ($500)</li>
  <li>other (fake snow, emergency cash, tools) ($300)</li>
</ul>
