Backers contribute a few of the final touches via stretch goals and perhaps name some cards before the project ships. That's fine (preferable even!), but this isn't one of those.</p>
<p>T.B.D. is a Break Kickstarter campaign to create a tabletop game where the theme, mechanics, and twists will be determined by backer votes during its funding period and subsequently developed by us into a game. <span class="bold">It's currently 0% designed.</span> We don't know what's in it, what it's about, or what it will actually be called, but you'll be able to get a copy for $20.</p>
<p>It may or may not include a box. It could be for one player or a hundred. It might fit on an airline tray table or require a whole backyard to play (if we can swing that for a $20 game). Is it a social deduction or a roll-and-write game? Maybe a deckbuilder? We don't know because the votes aren't in yet.</p>
<p>Space theme? Sure, but it doesn't need to be conventional—how about a game set in a lunar retirement village? One of our prior games had a salmon theme; another had a bee theme. Perhaps this game could be abstract with no theme at all. Our most recent title was a party word game—because spelling is fun (YES IT IS). We like doing unexpected stuff. Could it be a motorcycle cotillion? Why not?</p>
<p>We plan to design this game with you—our backers—right now. We're going to send you polls, livestream playtests and art, take questions, run a Discord channel, and share as much as we can to take this from bizarre idea to absurd reality. Of course, we won't be able to put every idea we receive in the final product, but we will bend a shoehorn stuffing in whatever we can while committing to making a coherent, playable (and hopefully delightful) game.</p>
<p>The method to the madness is **BRACKETS** and democracy. There will be three brackets: theme, mechanics, and twists. Each bracket will have 16 entries. The backers lucky enough to snag a qualifying pledge level will determine these entries, and then ALL backers will vote to determine the winning ideas. Those ideas will then be used as the core of ... whatever game T.B.D. turns out to be.</p>
<p>Will this be challenging? NO DOUBT. Making a game is hard enough when you have a solid theme and mechanics in mind. Leaving those details even partially up to the internet is notably foolish. We could end up making Boardy McGameface, but we'll roll with those punches. That's what we're signing up for.</p>
<p>Please support our completely indefensible foray into temerity and hubris, and back T.B.D. today.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div id="risks-and-challenges" class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"><div class="mobile-show py3"></div><h3 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h3><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">We have successfully designed and sold games before, but our intention is that this will be the first game we ever manufacture, produce and sell independently. This is also our first Kickstarter as a game publisher. It will undoubtedly be a challenge for us.

That said, we have the talent and tools required to make the game design work and to generate the production assets. We have access to a professional game design group that meets regularly. We have the networking contacts to support production and fulfillment, though none of those formal agreements are in place yet for the obvious reasons.

This project is objectively more risky than a standard tabletop Kickstarter. We don't know what we're sending you or precisely when it will be ready. This project does represent an estimate, but our solid commitment to make a game for you.

Other risks include:
- You might submit your ideas and we may not find a way to use them. You could be unhappy about that.
- It could take a really long time to get the game ready. This might test your patience.
- Communication will be frequent, but probably not daily. That could bother you one way or another.
- Marcus writes the updates, and his tone tends to be glib (and his vocabulary is too large and he might use words you don't know --Cara). If this Risks and Challenges writeup annoys you, the updates definitely will.</p><a target="_blank" class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16" href="/help/hc/sections/115001107133"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span> </span><a href="/projects/marcusross/break-kickstarter-tbd/faqs" class="bold link-blue type-16"><span></span></a></div></div></body></html>
