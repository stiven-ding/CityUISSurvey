But after having found fairly affordable tickets to the <i>(allegedly)</i> best Thrones tournament in the US, I hope to try and attend. When saying I <strong>couldn't</strong> attend without outside benefactors it was <i>hinted </i>to me that there are people in the community that would like to help me attend. So now I'm giving you all a platform in which you can contribute if you like. Since I am <i>very </i>uncomfortable asking for handouts I thought we'd try and create some content and opportunities together so that you get something in return! Check out all the different levels for more info.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But in order to attend I still need some help. If we reach 250€ I can attend. If we reach 500€ I can attend <strong>and</strong> I don't have to live on noodles for an extended period of time. If we&nbsp;<i>pass</i> the goal I will add more levels, swag and put everything towards next year's <strong>W.A.R</strong> tournament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The whole journey from deck-building to teary-eyed farwells will be documented and posted to Youtube.&nbsp;Once <i>at</i>&nbsp;the tournament I hope to make&nbsp;video updates, help&nbsp;out with the stream(if the esquisite hosts actually need it of course) and do player interviews. Lets find out together how well <strong>W.A.R</strong> matches up against Stahleck and RTS events!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Donation Goals</u></p><p>&lt;250$ - All donations is put towards Thrones W.A.R 2019 instead.</p><p>&nbsp; 250$&nbsp;- Attending! Pre &amp; Post Tourney documentation.</p><p>&nbsp; 300$ - Video updates from&nbsp;the event!</p><p>&nbsp; 400$ -&nbsp;Player Interviews at the event!</p><p>&nbsp; 500$ - Second Sons W.A.R Edition</p><p>&lt;500$ - <i>Everything earned passed this point is put towards Thrones W.A.R 2019</i></p><p>&nbsp; 666$ - <i>Everyone </i>who contributed 2$ or more gets 3x Littlefinger Alt-Art. Those who already donated towards the Alt-Arts gets this year's Varberg Morghulis house cards. Free shipping.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have suggestions for more donation Levels and Goals, shoot me a message on any of the sites/medias I frequent. I would like to have a Level in the 2-15$ range but ideas are a bit stale atm :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/458155961207297/">Thrones W.A.R event link</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>jesuisBuzz sites:</p><p><a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/jesuisBuzzZ/">Facebook</a></p><p><a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/jesuisBuzz">Youtube</a></p><p><a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.twitch.tv/jesuisBuzz">Twitch</a></p></div>
