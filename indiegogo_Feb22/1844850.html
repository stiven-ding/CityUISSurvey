The Nonviolent Resistance Manual will help activists around the world to share ideas, tactics, and strategies to make their campaigns more effective and sustainable. Theoretical content will be illustrated with real-life case studies, written by those involved in movements. All of the ideas will be linked to a relevant exercise to be used in trainings for nonviolent action and social change. The content will be clearly written and accessible, and translated into several languages by our volunteer team.<br></p><p>In 2014 we completed the printed version of the Handbook for Nonviolent Campaigns, a book of strategies and tactics for social change, written by 30 activists from around the world. The book has been read by thousands, and an online version of this important resource will allow us to significantly expand it's potential. The Nonviolent Resistance Manual will include new content from across the world, and we will continue to expand the resource in the years to come. The initial build work will be completed by early 2017, and cost us around £4,000 – we have already raised £3,000, and this crowdfunder will help us finish that off.<br></p><p></p>The new Nonviolent Resistance Manual website will:<ul>
                  <li>help us share skills and knowledge across movements internationally<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>be initially available in Spanish, German, and Turkish, with more languages added later</li>
                  <li>illustrate strategic thinking with real-life case studies</li>
                  <li>integrate exercises used by activists in nonviolence training sessions</li>
                  <li>allow writers to contribute their own ideas and stories, expanding the resource<br>
                  </li>
                  </ul><p>We have some exciting perks to offer as thanks for those who contribute to this project: badges, books and t-shirts, depending on how much you contribute! Our 'war is a crime against humanity' tshirts and tote bags will be hand printed to order.<br></p><p></p><p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474449220/white_text_on_black_shirt_rpoysv.png" style="" class="" data-src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474449220/white_text_on_black_shirt_rpoysv.png" data-airgap-id="15"></p><br><p>The Nonviolent Resistance Manual will help to make activists and movements more effective in their campaigning and direct action, more strategic in their planning, and to become more sustainable, as they learn from others and share stories and ideas. As well as stories and methods of campaigning and direct action, the Nonviolent Resistance Manual will also include strategies for undermining the structural causes of injustice, war and inequality, like housing or business cooperatives, community gardens, work-occupied factories, radical land reform movements, sharing economies, and alternative currencies.<br></p><p><b>War Resisters' International was formed in 1921.
