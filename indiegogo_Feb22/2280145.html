Our goal is to bring expert CPA tax advising to the other 99%. We have developed an award-winning platform to communicate and share documents with a CPA. By some estimates, Amercians leave upto $460 in excess refunds unclaimed because of the proliferation of do-it-yourself tax programs that prepare inaccurate tax returns and lead people to believe that they are saving money.</span></div></div></div> <!----> <div data-v-1df7bf5a="" class="routerContentStory-storyBody"><div>
                <p>About Taxhub</p>
                <p>The major players in the tax industry have been around for quite awhile. Their numbers are few and their offerings, limited. Which means they’ve been successful in spite of themselves. Without much competition, they’ve not needed to innovate.</p>
                <p>To customers, a stagnant business model means few options. But what if they worked harder for you? What if they offered more? What would that look like?</p>
                <p>We wondered the same thing. And decided this industry should work harder. This is our solution for you:</p>
                <p>The professional expertise of meeting with a private accountant – minus the high fee.</p>
                <p>The independence and comfort of doing it yourself in your own home – minus the guesswork over complicated tax questions.</p>
                <p>At TaxHub, we believe it’s time to bring the transparency of the new economy to places that haven’t embraced it yet. And the tax business is one of them. There is no excuse not to innovate, and offer your customers more and more every day. That’s our pledge, to you.</p>
                <p>You’ll pay about half what you’d pay an outside accountant, working with TaxHub. If you’ve earned a tax refund, we believe you should be able to enjoy that as much as possible. Not fork it over to us.</p>
